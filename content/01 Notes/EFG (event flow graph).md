## Definition

An Event flow graphs (EFG) contains all the possible sequences of interactions that can be performed on a [[SUT (system under test)]], often a  [[GUI (graphical user interface)]]. 

Similar to [[ESG (event sequence graph)]] and [[EIG (event interaction graph)]], but ==it focuses more on the global flow of the events==

An event flow graph is created by identifying the events on a GUI component
