## Definition

A Linux distribution (often called a distro) is a version of the Linux operating system that combines:
- The Linux [[kernel]] (the heart of the operating system, which manages the hardware),
- Additional software (such as tools, applications, libraries),
- A package management system (for installing, updating, and removing software),
- A user interface (typically a command-line shell, and often a graphical environment).

###  Why are there so many distributions?

Linux is open source, so anyone can take the kernel and build their own custom version on top of it, choosing different software and configurations for different purposes.

### What's the best Linux distribution?

Depends on your goals. Some popular examples of Linux distributions:
- **Ubuntu**: widely used on PCs and servers, user-friendly
- **Debian**: stable and widely used as a base for other distros
- **Fedora**: frequently updated, with cutting-edge software
- **Arch Linux**: minimalist, for advanced users
- **CentOS / Rocky Linux**: for servers and enterprise environments
- **Linux Mint**: very similar to Windows for those coming from there.
