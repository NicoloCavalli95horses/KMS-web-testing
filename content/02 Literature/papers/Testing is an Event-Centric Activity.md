## Abstract

Recent advances in techniques for testing [[GUI (graphical user interface)]] enabled to develop workflow models and successfully employ them to generate large numbers of test cases.

The key to the success of these event-focused techniques, especially [[EFG (event flow graph)]] and [[ESG (event sequence graph)]], is that they primarily focus on the **input**, and the workflow is modeled in simple terms.

If necessary, the event-focused techniques can be augmented to model more complex systems and processes: we can extend these techniques to domains other than GUIs, to ==create a general event-driven paradigm for testing==

### Main concepts

[[systematic testing]] implies that the [[SUT (system under test)]] is predictable, controllable and observable (*monitorable* system). The grade of testability of a SUT should be measurable.
- events are essential to monitor a system
