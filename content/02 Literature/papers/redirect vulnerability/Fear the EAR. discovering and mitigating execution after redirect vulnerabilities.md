## Context

An [[EAR (Execution After Redirect)]] occurs when, after a redirect, the web server does not stop its execution and extra information are revealed by mistake

**Contributions**
- categorize EARs and provide analysis of 9 frameworks susceptible of EARs
- an algorithm to detect EARs in Ruby on Rails applications
- a white-box tool tested on 18127 applications which found 3944 EARs

## Approach

9 different framework were tested to assess their default behavior in the EAR context
- **Ruby on Rails**: the execution is not automatically halted after`redirect_to`. Information leakage are impossible on this framework because a controller can either perform a redirect or render a response
- **Grails**: behavior similar to RoR, but the render behavior is less explicit
- **Django**: Django’s documentation makes it clear that calling Django’s redirect function merely returns a subclass of the HttpResponse object. Thus, there is no reason for the developer to expect the code to halt
- **ASP.NET MVC 3.0**:  similar to Django, prevent EARs by default
- **Zend (PHP)**: not susceptible to EAR vulnerabilities because its redirect methods immediately result in the termination of server-side code, but this default behavior may be disabled
- **CakePHP**: not susceptible to EAR by default
- **CodeIgniter (PHP)**: very lightweight PHP framework that offer protection against EAR, but only if the redirect function is used correctly
- ...
