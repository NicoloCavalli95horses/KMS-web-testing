## What is CVE?

The mission of the CVE Program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cyber security vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities are discovered, then assigned and published by organizations from around the world.
Partners publish CVE Records to communicate consistent descriptions of vulnerabilities.

Information technology and cyber security professionals use CVE Records to ensure they are discussing the same issue, and to coordinate their efforts to prioritize and address the vulnerabilities.
