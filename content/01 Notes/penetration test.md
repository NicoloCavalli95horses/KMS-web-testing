## Definition

Penetration testing (or pen-testing) concerns submitting various malicious instances to a [[SUT (system under test)]] to verify if the instances can actually penetrate it. 
- If penetration is successful, it means that vulnerabilities exist

According to Gordon et al. (2006), penetration testing is the most popular in determining vulnerabilities in Web applications. Table 13 presents a comprehensive comparison of the various tools available today.
