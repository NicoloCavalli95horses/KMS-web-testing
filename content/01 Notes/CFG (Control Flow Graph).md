## Definition

A Control Flow Graph (CFG) is a graphical representation of the flow of control within a program or function.
The nodes of the graph represent blocks of instructions (basic blocks), while the edges represent the possible paths that control can follow from one block to another (e.g. after an if, a while, etc.).
