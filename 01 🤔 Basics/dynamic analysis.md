## Main concepts


Dynamic program analysis is the act of ==analyzing software that involves executing a program== â€“ as opposed to [[static analysis]], which does not execute it.

Analysis can focus on different aspects of the software, including but not limited to:
- behavior,
- test coverage,
- performance,
- security

To be effective, the target program must be executed with sufficient test inputs to address the ranges of possible inputs and outputs.

Software testing measures, such as code coverage, and tools such as mutation testing, are used to identify where testing is inadequate.
