**Reviews**
- SLR: structured/systematic literature review
- SMS: structured mapping study. More output, it analyzes the quality of the papers
- SR: 

It is recommended to report the review methodology in a flowchart

**SMS map chart**

SMS assesses the quantity of the papers but does not tells too much about the quality. That's what an SLR is helpful for

**Meta-analysis**: rare in SE, common in medicine
- analyzing other reviews to spot trends

CASP (Critical Appraisals Skill Program) is a checklist to assess rigor, credibility, and relevance in empirical research


Do not use RegEx in query strings in papers  (it is not reliable)

https://dl.acm.org/search/advanced : select "the ACM guide to computing literature" (it will fetch material even from Springer and other relevant sources)

**MSR (Mining software repository)**
Analyzing data stored in software repositories
- mining: extracting knowledge (meaningful patterns, trends)
- combine SE and data science to get relevant information

**Types of repo**
- version control systems
- issue trackers (Jira, Bugzilla)
- code review systems (Gerrit, Phabricator)
- communication logs (mailing lists, Slack)
- knowledge websites

Mining tools: 
- PyDriller
- repositories APIs

Clean your data that can skew the results

Replicability
- you store your results (so everyone can replicate your analysis on the dataset)
- you define commits intervals so that everyone can fetch the same repo at the same state

**Exercise**
- a proposal of MSR
- define data source to mine
- clarify inclusion criteria
- describe how would you analyze the data
- discuss threats and limitations
- describe how would you present the results
