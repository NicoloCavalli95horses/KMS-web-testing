### Qualitative methods

**Case study**
- complex research strategy 
- present particular case in depth
- use multiple qualitative methods
- used to better understand the topic

**Action research**
Doing and intervention in a case study, tracking the consequences of the intervention (e.g., to test another management method a company, to improve a product, etc.)

**Observational study**

**Citizen science**
Old method of research (e.g., biologists or naturalists): implies going in the field (literally), observing and reporting results (e.g., classifying butterflies)
- many people may be involved (even volunteering)

**Survey**: useful when the population is very specific and the variables to be measured are clear

**Focus group**: people selected for their expertise and or as exponents of diverging opinions

**Diary study**
Allows researchers to construct pictures of social reality from the actors' perspective, based on detailed information about events and activities in the participants work lives
- diaries can elicit information that are difficult to assess or recall accurately, are easily forgotten, or are sensitive information

**Grounded theory**: systematic methodology for theory construction/discovery through the bottom-up analysis of data
- open-ended inquiry produces data without underlying theory
- the data is studied in a systematic way to construct/discover a theory to explain the data
- this can be done in both automatic quantitative ways (e.g., data mining), and qualitative ways (e.g., interpretation, speculations)

**Structured abstracts**
Put sections on the abstracts
- background
- aims
- method
- results/findings
- conclusions

next lesson group:

- the italian guy
- the ireland guy

try to put everything together
consider as topic: AI, productivity, security,

eg., Will AI lead to firing devs? 

Think about multiple studies that can be connected to answer this Q
- literature review. What would you do?
- empirical studies. What would you do?
