In this paper, we model the web application as an extended finite state machine and present a black-box approach for deriving the application specification and detecting malicious SQL queries that violate the specification. Several challenges arise, such as how to extract persistent state information in the database and infer data constraints. We systematically extract a set of invariants from observed SQL queries and responses, as well as session variables, as the application specification. Any suspicious SQL queries that violate corresponding invariants are identified as potential attacks. We implement a prototype detection system SENTINEL (SEcuriNg daTabase from logIc flaws iN wEb appLication) and evaluate it using a set of real-world web applications. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that acceptable performance overhead is incurred by our implementation.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Second ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy}, pages = {25â€“36}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {web application security, logic flaw, invariant, extended finite state machine, SQL signature}, location = {San Antonio, Texas, USA}, series = {CODASPY '12} }
