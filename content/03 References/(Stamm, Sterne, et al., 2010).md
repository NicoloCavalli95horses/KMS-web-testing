Content restrictions allow site designers or server administrators to specify how content interacts on their web sites-a security mechanism desperately needed by the untamed Web. These content restrictions rules are activated and enforced by supporting web browsers when a policy is provided for a site via HTTP, and we show how a system such as CSP can be effective to lock down sites and provide an early alert system for vulnerabilities on a web site. Our scheme is also easily deployed, which is made evident by our prototype implementation in Firefox and on the Mozilla Add-Ons web site.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web}, pages = {921â€“930}, numpages = {10}, keywords = {web security, security policy, http, content restrictions}, location = {Raleigh, North Carolina, USA}, series = {WWW '10} }
