## Definition

Mutation testing is a technique used from many years to evaluate the effectiveness of test suites in detecting bugs. The idea is to modify the source code and observing whether the tests respond correctly to those changes, with the end goal of improving the quality of the tests


> [!SUMMARY]
> The applicationâ€™s under test source code is  automatically modified by inserting variations
of the original software code simulating typical errors a developer could make during
development and maintenance activities.
