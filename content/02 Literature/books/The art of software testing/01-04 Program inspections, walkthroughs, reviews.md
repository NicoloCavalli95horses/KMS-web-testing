# Preface

Testing is one of the most important computer topics:
- How do you ensure that all of the software you produce does what it was designed to do ([[positive testing]]), and doesn’t do what it isn’t supposed to do? ([[negative testing]])

# Introduction

The approach of the book is practical and evidence-based. No mathematical proofs of the correctness of a program are considered

# 1. Self-assessment test

Computers and softwares affect more people and businesses now than ever before.
Software is *pervasive*: there are few tools nowadays that are not software driven. Hence, testing should be pervasive too.

A general negative attitude toward testing is registered:
- using libraries and dependencies that have been pre-tested "justify" a lack of attention in testing activities
- tight deadlines and time contraints
- complex development environment and few resources

# 2. The psychology and Economics of Software Testing

In an ideal world, we would want to test every possible permutation of a program. In most cases, however, this simply is not possible (see [[CA (covering array)]] to redure permutations number).
