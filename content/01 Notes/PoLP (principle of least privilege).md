## Definition

Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is a foundational security principle that states that users, applications, and systems ==should be granted the minimum level of access and permissions necessary to perform their tasks, and no more.==
- The goal is to reduce attack surfaces and prevent unauthorized access.

### Example

A junior developer in a company should not have admin access to production servers.
