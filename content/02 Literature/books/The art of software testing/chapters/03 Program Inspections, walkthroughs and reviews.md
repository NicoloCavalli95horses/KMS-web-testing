## Manual testing methods

Team approaches:
- [[code inspection]]
- [[code walkthrough]]

==**Code inspections** and **walkthroughs**== involve a team of people reading or visually inspecting a program. The goal is to find errors, but not solutions

A group of developer (3-4) performs a review, where only 1 participant is the author:
- 30-70% of the logic-design and coding errors are found through code inspections and walkthroughs
- certain types of errors are easily found with these methods (e.g. uninitialized variables), while others are harder to see at a glance (e.g., divide by zero errors)

One-man approaches
- [[desk checking]]
- [[peer rating]]
