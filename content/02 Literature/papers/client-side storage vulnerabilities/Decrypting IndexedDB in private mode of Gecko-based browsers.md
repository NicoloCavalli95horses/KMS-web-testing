## Context

This paper shows how to ==decrypt client-side storages==, specifically [[IndexedDB]] storage on Gecko-based browsersâ€™ private mode, ==by extracting cipherkeys== in memory.
- Experimental results indicate that when private session is running, our proof-of-concept tool successfully decrypts all encrypted files
- Additionally, there is a possibility of ==recovering data even in an inactive state (with the computer turned off)== by utilizing *hibernation file* on disk

## Approach
