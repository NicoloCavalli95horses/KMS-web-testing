## Context

With the growth of online transactions and the use of web applications, users are becoming more vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as identity theft, [[phishing]], and other types of fraud.
- front-end is the first layer of protection for users but also the first target of attacks

The purpose of this study is to identify the most effective security methods and technologies for the front-end, aimed at protecting user data and ensuring their privacy.
## Approach

The study includes a comparative analysis and critical review of various front-end security technologies:
- [[Content-security Policy (CSP)]]
- [[CSFR (cross-site request forgery)]]
- [[HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure]]
- [[XSS (cross site scripting)]]
- authentication and authorization mechanisms:
	- username, email and password
	- biometric identification (see [[behavioral biometrics analysis]])
	- [[sessions token]]

Attacks mitigation and prevention:
- [[WAFs (web application firewall system)]]
- [[IDS and IPS (intrusion detection, intrusion prevention system)]]
- advanced logging monitoring
