A successful attack allows the attacker to fully impersonate the victim towards the vulnerable Web application. We analyse the vulnerability pattern and identify its root cause in the separation of concerns between the application logic, which is responsible for the authentication processes, and the framework support, which handles the task of session tracking. Based on this result, we present and discuss three distinct server-side measures for mitigating Session Fixation vulnerabilities. Each of our countermeasures is tailored to suit a specific real-life scenario that might be encountered by the operator of a vulnerable Web application.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2011 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing}, pages = {1531â€“1537}, numpages = {7}, location = {TaiChung, Taiwan}, series = {SAC '11} }
