## Definition

Security testing is the process of assessing whether the features of a software are consistent with the expected security requirements.

The literature reports two main security testing approaches:
- **security functional testing**: focuses on validating whether specified security requirements have been correctly implemented
- **security vulnerability testing**: aims to identify unintended vulnerabilities in a [[SUT (system under test)]] - defined as errors in the system design, implementation, operation, or management that can be exploited to perform improper actions in the system (e.g., collecting sensible users’ data)

 Security vulnerability testing is performed by:
 - ==simulating attacks== or conducting a [[penetration test]] to compromise the system’s security
 - ==identifying system risks and generating tests to uncover vulnerabilities ==associated with those risks
