They are particularly used by threat agents to get more likes and/or followers in Online Social Networks (OSNs). This paper reviews the [[clickjacking]] attacks and the classic solutions to tackle various forms of those attacks. Different approaches of Cross-Site Scripting attacks are implemented in this study to study the attack tools and methods. Various iFrame attacks have been developed to tamper with the integrity of the website interactions at the application layer. By visually demonstrating the attacks such as Cross-Site scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), users will be able to have a better understanding of such attacks in their formulation and the risks associated with them.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the The 3rd Multidisciplinary International Social Networks Conference on SocialInformatics 2016, Data Science 2016}, articleno = {45}, numpages = {6}, keywords = {Online Social Networks, Cross-Site scripting, Cross-Site Request Forgery}, location = {Union, NJ, USA}, series = {MISNC, SI, DS 2016} }
