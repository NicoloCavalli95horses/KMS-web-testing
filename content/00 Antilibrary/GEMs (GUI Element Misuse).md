## Definition

GEMS (GUI Element Misuse) are a novel class of access control vulnerabilities in [[GUI (graphical user interface)]].
- GEMs arise when developers rely on and misuse UI elements attributes to implement access control checks
- GEMs can be used as a basis for privilege escalation exploits and general access control bypass (GEMs based privilege escalation)
