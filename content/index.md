## Project structure

#### 00 Antilibrary
An antilibrary is a collection of books that are owned but have not yet been read. The term was coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in *The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable*. Hence, the antilibrary includes all the notes that are not yet written.

#### 01 Notes
All notes taken so far. Each note has a unique ID and one or more tags that classify its content, making it easier to find notes related to the same topic.

#### 02 Literature
Books and articles are summarized here. The main concepts and ideas extracted from articles or books are linked to notes included in the previous section.

#### 03 References
This folder includes all references used by articles or notes in general. References are in BibTeX format and (may) include a link to the original source, if any.

#### 98 Templates
Templates are boilerplate notes to standardize the note taking process.
