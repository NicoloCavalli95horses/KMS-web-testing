## Context

Literature reviews produce valuable insights by:
- describing a phenomenon (==narrative review==)
- understanding a phenomenon (==scoping review==)
- explaining a phenomenon (==realist review==)
- testing a theory (==meta-analysis==)

## Approach

Qualitative analysis of papers related to philosophy of science

## Results

Different concepts are crucial to understand if you want to build a good systematic literature review:
- **systematicity**: refers to the way the review is executed, the rules that follows and the methods used to compose the paper's list
- **transparency**: is achieved when the elements of the review process are explicitly detailed
- **reproducibility**: it has been defined as ==the ability to re-perform the methods of a research== but also as ==the ability to duplicate the results of a research==
