In a [[clickjacking]] attack, a malicious page is constructed such that it tricks victims into clicking on an element of a different page that is only barely (or not at all) visible. By stealing the victim's clicks, an attacker could force the user to perform an unintended action that is advantageous for the attacker (e.g., initiate an online money transaction). Although [[clickjacking]] has been the subject of many discussions and alarming reports, it is currently unclear to what extent [[clickjacking]] is being used by attackers in the wild, and how significant the attack is for the security of Internet users.In this paper, we propose a novel solution for the automated and efficient detection of [[clickjacking]] attacks. We describe the system that we designed, implemented and deployed to analyze over a million unique web pages. The experiments show that our approach is feasible in practice. Also, the empirical study that we conducted on a large number of popular websites suggests that [[clickjacking]] has not yet been largely adopted by attackers on the Internet.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 5th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security}, pages = {135â€“144}, numpages = {10}, keywords = {[[web security]], javascript, [[clickjacking]], browser plug-in, HTML IFRAME, CSS, ClickIDS}, location = {Beijing, China}, series = {ASIACCS '10} }
