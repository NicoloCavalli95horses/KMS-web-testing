## Abstract

[[GUI (graphical user interface)]] contain a number of common visual elements widgets such as buttons, textfields, and lists, and GUIs typically provide the ability to change attributes on these widgets to control their visibility and behavior. 
- While these attributes are extremely useful to provide visual cues to users to guide them through an applicationâ€™s GUI, they can also be misused for purposes they were not intended
- in applications with multiple privileges levels, GUI element attributes may be misused to obtain access to protected resources, execute functions without permissions, etc

In this paper, a new method to detect misuse of GUI elements is presented
