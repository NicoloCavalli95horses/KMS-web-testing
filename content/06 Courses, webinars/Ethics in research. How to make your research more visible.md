https://osf.io/ platform to deposit preregistration of studies (protocols)
- in some cases (medicine) is required to have your protocol approved before publishing the research
- make it possible to receive feedback sooner

**Harking**: the bad practice of making hypothesis after results are known. This is scientific misconducts. The preregistration is supposed to prevent harking

**Nepotistic or predatory journals**: your friend or family are part of the journal's board, so the peer-review of the research is biased

**Where to register a study**
- Prospero for biology and health sciences
- Zenodo for every discipline. You can put here publication, dataset, and receive feedback from the community
- OSF for psychology, medicine and hard sciences
- PCR RR (peer-community review) can review the preprint deposited in the previous platforms. A positive feedback from PCR RR makes you more likely to be published in a high-ranked journal

**Journal finders**
How to find a relevant journal
- **bison**, built upon DOAJ and OpenCites. DOAJ is a white-list of relevant journals in the wild
- **web of science journal finder**
- **open journal matcher**
- **perplexity.ai**

**IF (impact factor)**: are widely know to be biased and non-transparent
- it just considers the number of citations per year
- does not actually assess the quality of a work

OpenAlex database: https://openalex.org/
- a transparent tool to assess the number of citations of a paper

**Should you deposit a preprint of your paper?** (=prepublication, the last stage of the manuscript before the review)
- in some disciplines a paper is rejected if a prepublication is found, because it means that you bypassed the peer-review project
- in other disciplines might be a good idea to fasten the visibility of your work if it is a breakthrough discovery that could be helpful to other. But since your paper will be published immediately without review, if the discovery turns out to be wrong this may impact also the work of other people that have used your preprint has a reference
- sometimes you have to do it because your founder requires you to do it

**Embargo**
In academia, an "embargo" is a ==restriction placed on a thesis or dissertation that allows only the title, abstract and citation information to be available to the public==, while the full text of the work is kept hidden for a limited period of time.

**Green road**: once you have published something, you should be able to put an open-access copy of your work in a open-database (e.g., HAL, https://hal.science/?lang=en)
- you need the AAM (author accepted manuscript) from your journal before uploading your paper here
- you need to change the graphic layout of the paper not to make it related to the journal you have published in
- sometimes your journal proposed you an embargo, a time you have to wait before publishing
- the law guarantees you a shorter embargo than the one often proposed by journal. Journals do their interests and try to make the embargo longer
- often you can negotiate the embargo with the journal
- often you have to wait 3, 6 or 12 months depending on your discipline

**Gold road**
- aims at an immediate open access
- you might be requested to pay some charges (article publishing charges - APC)
- 

**Diamond road:**

> [!WARNING] Making money on science
> Elsevier has 37.8% of profit margin, does not have to pay researchers, it just exploits its reputation and the hard work of a number of researchers. It is more than Apple profit margin!
