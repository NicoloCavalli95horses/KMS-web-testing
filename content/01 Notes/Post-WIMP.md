## Definition

A post-WIMP interface is one containing at least one interaction technique not dependent on classical 2D widgets such as menus and icons. Ultimately, it will involve all senses in parallel, natural language communication and multiple users.

**Post-WIMP**: GUI that includes [[multi-event interactions]], or [[multi-modal interactions]] or [[ad hoc widgets]]
