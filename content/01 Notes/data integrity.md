## Definition

Data integrity relates to the trustworthiness of information resources and to ensuring that only authorized users can alter the data, in a way that is predicted by design.

### Web data integrity

The integrity of web content relies on the integrity of the HTTP request-response model. If the model fails, or can be tampered, the data integrity might be violated.
- the current focus is on the implementation of cryptographic rules rather than the implementation of a security analysis of system functions
