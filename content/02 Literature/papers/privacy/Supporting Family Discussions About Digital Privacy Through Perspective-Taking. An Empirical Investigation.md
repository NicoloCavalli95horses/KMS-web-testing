## Context

Families play a critical role in shaping childrenâ€™s understanding of digital privacy. Without guided discussions, it is difficult for parents and children to maintain open communication about privacy concerns
- most teens rarely communicate with their parents about their online experiences and related privacy issues, often due to their worries about parental reactions or control

## Approach

This empirical study investigates how guided family discussions, supported by perspective taking theory, can foster mutual understanding and improve digital privacy literacy in kids aged 13 and older (age when they begin to use digital spaces)

This study wants to facilitate digital privacy discussion between parents and children

**RQ1**: What communication issues hinder perspective-taking in family discussions about digital privacy? 

**RQ2**: How can facilitation strategies be designed to enhance perspective-taking between parents and children?

**Method**: qualitative study with 13 parent-child pairs

## Results

1) the tendency to discuss privacy in abstract terms rather than concrete terms
2) the reliance on absolute statements and oversimplified rules
3) the pattern of declining engagement from teens when their views were opposed

There are limitations in privacy literacy from both parents and kids.
Parents tend to implement a one-sided communication
