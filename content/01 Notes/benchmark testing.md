## Definition

Benchmark testing is performed to evaluate the performance of a product or system against established standards or benchmarks. It allows you to determine their strengths and weaknesses and to identify areas for improvement.

- [The buggy web app (bWAPP)](http://www.itsecgames.com/)
- [The Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA)
- [The Xtreme Vulnerable Web Application (XVWA)](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/xtreme-vulnerable-web-application-xvwa-1,209/)
- [WackoPicko](https://github.com/adamdoupe/WackoPicko)
- 22 real-world WordPress plugins with known vulnerabilities. Except for some commercial plugins, a pluginâ€™s source code is open, allowing to download and install it in your environment
