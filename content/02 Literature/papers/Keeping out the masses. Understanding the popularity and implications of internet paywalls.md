Goals of the paper:
- measuring how widely paywalls have been adopted
- present an automated system for detecting whether a site uses a paywall

The web is increasingly moving away from “open” models to “paywalled” models (see [[paywalls]]), to keep the user engaged with the platform.

People are annoyed by ad-based websites because:
- Google and Facebook have a monopoly on the advertising industry (70% of revenues)
- Ad-based funding systems suffer from significant and increasing rates of fraud
- privacy concerns
