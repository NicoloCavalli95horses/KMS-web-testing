## Definition

Concolic execution is an automated testing technique used to test programs in great detail by attempting to explore various paths of code execution. Instead of running tests on fixed inputs, concolic execution ==tries to combine various inputs and conditions== to see how the program reacts to different scenarios. This can help uncover bugs and issues that would be difficult to find with traditional tests.
