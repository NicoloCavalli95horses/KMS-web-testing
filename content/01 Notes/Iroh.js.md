## Definition
 
Iroh allows you to track, intercept and manipulate all data in your code duringexecution. You can collect and change types, parameters, return values, allocated objects, variables, expressions, function calls and so on.

[[dynamic analysis]] is in contrast to [[static analysis]] (e.g. used in JavaScript linters)
- Dynamic analysis allows to collect runtime data and how the code behaves during execution
- Static analysis allows to get information based on the source code, but without any runtime informations. With static analysis it's up to impossible to get a sense of how the program will actually behave.
