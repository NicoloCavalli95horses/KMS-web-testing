## Definition

BRF (Balance Random Forest) is a variant of [[random forest]] technique designed to solve the problem of imbalanced dataset. That is, a dataset in which a class has much more example of another one (e.g., in a dataset of bank transactions, regular transactions are much more frequent that fraudulent transactions).

It is a [[machine learning]] technique used to classify an input into a predetermined output class.

## When to use

- when is important to include even the less represented class in a dataset (rare classes detection), reducing the bias toward more numerous classes
- in all the situations in which you need to detect rare cases (fraud detection, medical diagnostics, errors or anomalies in a [[SUT (system under test)]])
