## Definition

Phishing refers to the practice of ==manipulating the user with the goal of stealing confidential information== (login credentials, payment card details, etc). This is usually done:
- by creating fake web pages that mimic legitimate resources (*phoney web pages*)
- by using persuasive emails 

**Why people still fall for phishing?**
The average user is unable to distinguish malicious web pages from legitimate ones and does not have enough technical information about URLs. Therefore:
- does not know which URL to trust (for example: embedded in e-mail text, in a displayed tooltip, in the status bar)
- does not see the whole URL of a web page, due to tiny URL services
- clicks on links without checking, for an habituation effect

**A matter of bad UI design for cyber-security**
The role of the user interface design is not negligible [[(Spero, Biddle, 2021)]]
- a UI that prioritize the "primary tasks" and does not stress cyber-security features enough can lead to an incorrect [[mental model]] of the software, which can lead to an incorrect though (e.g., this link is legitimate), which can lead to an incorrect and unsafe behavior (e.g. clicking on the phishing link)
### Examples

Attackers may study the email communications of an employee for a while, and then at some opportune moment send an email spoofing the identity of a trusted other asking for a transfer of funds, which will be deposited into the attackerâ€™s account
