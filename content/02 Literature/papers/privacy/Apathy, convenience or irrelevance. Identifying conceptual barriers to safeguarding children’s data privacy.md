## Context

This article explores conceptual barriers to protecting children’s personal information in relation to online commercial data practices (see [[privacy]]). It does this by using Vedder’s conceptual categories of privacy to identify and position parents’ and teenagers’ concepts of privacy within interpersonal, institutional and commercial contexts.

## Approach

Qualitative research based on interviews with open questions:
- RQ1: what concepts of privacy are most valued by parents and teenagers?
- RQ2: where are these positioned across interpersonal, institutional and commercial contexts?
- RQ3: what conceptual barriers are there to fostering responsibility for data privacy self-management beyond interpersonal contexts?
- RQ4: how do parents position themselves in relation to caretaking younger children’s data privacy?

### Results

- The collection of personal data is especially problematic when considering children whose online activity is subjected to extensive commercial surveillance and data mining 
- personal data creates digital ==dossiers that may follow young people into adulthood==, potentially affecting future life opportunities in education, health care, employment and access to financial credit 
- there is ==no agreement on the age at which children can be managing their data privacy==, minimum age of consent may vary between 12 to 16 years
- by choosing an age threshold, regulators ==make assumptions that teenagers and parents are both able and willing to make informed decisions== when engaging with online data consent mechanisms
- In many countries, children are not treated as if they deserve special treatment
- children's privacy is a problem that has been ==delegated almost entirely to their parents==
