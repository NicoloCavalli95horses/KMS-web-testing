Unsystematic literature review, but well-written and with a good set of references

### Context

This work studies [[XSS (cross site scripting)]] and its origin, manifestation, kinds of dangers and mitigation techniques. Different approaches proposed by researchers are presented and analyzed

### Considerations

A good solution is trade off between performance, amount of manual work, easy implementation and adaption of new threats. Researchers should think beyond conventional techniques of security, using program analysis, algorithm design, pattern recognition and AI
