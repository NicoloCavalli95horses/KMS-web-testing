## Context

High-level history of web browser and web technology evolution. Web attacks are described in a general fashion taking in account both server and client issues:
- [[buffer overflow]]
- sample code: sample applications or test scripts that are badly coded and can be exploited
- [[string validation]] attacks
- format string attacks
- canonicalisation attacks: attacks related to file naming exploitation on the server-side
- **encoding attacks**: used to bypass [[RegEx (Regular Expression)]] checks
- privilege escalation
- form tampering
- user-created content: back-doors or malicious server-side includes are uploaded into vulnerable web application to assist in web attacks
- [[XSS (cross site scripting)]]
- [[SQLIA (SQL injection attack)]]
- [[IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)]]
- remote malicious file inclusion: common in old PHP
- [[CSRF (cross-site request forgery)]]
- [[access control]] weaknesses
- authentication and session management failures
- data confidentiality failures
- poor [[error]] handling
