## Abstract

GUI design is currently shifting from designing GUIs composed of [[standard widgets]] to designing GUIs relying on more natural interactions and [[ad hoc widgets]].  
This shift is meant to support the advent of GUIs providing users with more adapted and natural interactions, and the support of new input devices such as multi-touch screens with [[multi-modal interactions]].

Standard widgets (e.g. buttons) are more and more replaced by ad hoc ones (e.g. the drawing area of graphical editors), and interactions are shifting from [[mono-event interaction]] (e.g. button pressures) to [[multi-event interactions ]](e.g. multi-touch and gesture-based
interactions). 

As a consequence, the current GUI model-based testing approaches, which target event-based systems, show their limits when applied to test such new advanced GUIs. The work introduced in this paper establishes the following contributions:
- a precise analysis of these limits (1)
- a proposition to tackle the identified limits by leveraging the [[Malai]] GUI specification language and by proposing the concept of interaction-action-flow graph (2)
- feedback from two use cases
- an industrial project and an open-source application, where the proposed approach has been applied.

==In GUI testing, test models are mainly [[EFG (event flow graph)]]. Test scripts can be are automatically generated by traversing an EFG according to specific test criterion.== Test scripts are executed on the [[SUT (system under test)]] manually or automatically. Finally, GUI oracles yield test verdicts by comparing effective results of test scripts with the expected ones.

This paper proposes to leverage [[UIDL (User Interface Description Language)]] dedicated to build
models of advanced GUIs, in order to drive the generation of test scenarios.

**1. Limits of traditional testing frameworks**
Traditional testing frameworks are based on [[UIDL (User Interface Description Language)]] that presents the following limits:
- ==UIDL describe the widget but not the interaction.== This is because current GUI testing framework are applied only to standard widget, which interaction is always the same.
- UIDL ==do not support multi-event interactions==
- UIDL ==do not (and cannot) describe the expected result== of the use of a widget in the SUT
- UIDL ==do not show the dependencies between actions or interactions== (e.g. the "paste" function depends on the "copy" function)

 [[EFG (event flow graph)]] have also a role in the developing of traditional testing frameworks. But EFG:
 - ==mix both interaction, widget and action under the term event.== This can lead to confusion in ad hoc widgets that support multi-event interactions

*There is a lack of proper abstractions to build test model for testing advanced GUIs*

**2. A proposal to tackle limits using Malai**
