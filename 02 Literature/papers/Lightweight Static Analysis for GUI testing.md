## Abstract
Using a black-box model to generate event sequences that are executable on the GUI. The black-box model can be:
- [[EFG (event flow graph)]]
- [[ESG (event sequence graph)]]

In this paper we propose a new approach to ==select relevant event sequences among the event sequences generated by a black-box model==
- events and events handlers are extracted from the GUI
- a dependency relation is determined (e.g., event B cannot happen if event A is not triggered before)
- the detected dependency relation leads to a [[EDG (Event Dependency Graph)]], which can be used to infer the relevance of a sequence, but it says nothing about the executability
- EDG is used together with a black-box model to construct a selection of executable and relevant test cases:

This approach brought to life **Gazoo**, a tool that has been tested on four open source GUI applications. Previously undetected bugs are found.
