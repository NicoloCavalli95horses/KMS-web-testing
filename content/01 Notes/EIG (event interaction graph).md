## Definition

An Event Interaction Graph (EIG) is a graphical representation used in software testing to model and analyze interaction between events, often in a [[GUI (graphical user interface)]].

**Nodes**: represent events of the [[SUT (system under test)]], generated by the user (e.g., click on a button, menu selection) or by the system itself

**Arches**: represent transitions between events. There could be:
- logic sequences
- casual relationships

Similar to [[EFG (event flow graph)]] and [[ESG (event sequence graph)]], but it focuses on:
- highlighting ==dependencies between events==
- detecting ==illegal interactions or conflicts== between events

See [[event models comparison]]
