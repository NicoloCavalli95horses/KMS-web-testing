## Definition

"Eating your own dog food" or "dogfooding" is the practice of using one's own products or services.

This can be a way for an organization to test its products in real-world usage using product management techniques. Hence dogfooding can act as quality control, and eventually a kind of testimonial advertising. Once in the market, dogfooding can demonstrate developers' confidence in their own products
