## Context

**Browser extension-related attacks**
Browser's extensions extend the functionality of a web browser, enhancing browsing experience and providing extra useful functionalities (e.g., video extractors, thumbnail generators, form fillers, etc). The availability of extension may even influence how popular a browser is
- malicious or "benign-but-buggy" extensions may be misused by attackers

Many Firefox extensions are over-privileged (2010) and display insecure programming practices.

**Background on Firefox extension**
Legacy Firefox extensions can leverage a rich API through a framework called XPCOM (Cross Platform Component Object Model). XPCOM allows the development of components, each defining a set of interfaces.
- Firefox extensions are usually written in JavaScript and can interoperate with XPCOM via a technology called XPConnect
- Firefox extensions can access filesystem, network and stored passwords
- Firefox extensions have full control over the visual appearance and functionality of the browser window. The [[GUI (graphical user interface)]] of any window can be modified via XUL (XML User Interface Language). This allow malicious browser extensions to design [[clickjacking]] attacks
- The legacy XPCOM framework is designed to allow all extensions to share the same JavaScript namespace. This means that a malicious extension could access variables defined by other extensions to steal sensitive information or to overwrite functions and objects
- A modern framework for developing secure Firefox extensions is Add-on SDK (project Jetpack)
