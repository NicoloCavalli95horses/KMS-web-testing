## Context

To this day, PHP is the server-side language that drives *over 75% of the websites.* Automated security testing tools promise to facilitate the discovery of vulnerabilities.
- One such approach is [[fuzzing]] testing, in which a fuzzer generates seemingly random inputs fed to the target application to trigger unintended behavior, potentially leading to vulnerabilities

Little work exists on grey box coverage-guided fuzzing to web applications due to the research strong focus on low-level applications (fuzzing is mostly used with binary)

**Contributions**
- A novel crawler-free approach to seeding the fuzzer with endpoints, allowing more fine-grained control over the fuzzing scope
- A novel [[instrumentation]] approach without modifications to the fuzzed applicationâ€™s source code or related components (i.e., databases), capable of intercepting PHP exceptions or errors, and bypassing authentication and authorization functionality to collect more code coverage
- A novel vulnerability detection approach to discover web vulnerability, supporting parallel fuzzing out-of-the-box, making it suitable for large-scale fuzzing testing
## Background

This work focuses on ==user-supplied input (HTTP headers, cookies, query, body parameters), to PHP functions== that result in a vulnerability.

**Vulnerabilities covered by PHUZZ**
- [[SQLIA (SQL injection attack)]]: attacker-controlled input becomes part of a SQL-query sent to a database
- [[RCE (Remote Code Execution)]]: attacker-controlled input is executed as part of a shell command
- Insecure deserialization (IDes):  deserialization functions are called with attacker-controlled input
- [[directory traversal (path traversal)]]: the attacker controls parts of the file path passed to file related functions
- [[XXE (XML external entities)]]: the attacker can pass XML to vulnerable XML parsers
- [[XSS (cross site scripting)]]: the attacker can include HTML markup or JavaScript in a vulnerable website due to missing sanitation
- [[redirect attack]]: the attacker can manipulate the location to which a browser is redirected

## Challenges 

- using the PHP interpreter to instrument the high-level PHP code at runtime
- coverage information must be shared using a shared filesystem
- errors and vulnerabilities do not actually cause a crash, because they are handled by PHP, which emits exceptions or error message and abort the execution
- a web application may display multi-step actions for specific functionality (e.g., multiple step forms). In this case, a chain of input values must be provided
- with web fuzzing, the input generated must consider a number of constraints (e.g., the HTTP request structure, body content, POST parameters). Phuzz approaches this challenging task by performing byte-level mutations on the input parameters and not the entire HTTP request, thus ensuring that the request is valid
