## Definition

Parallel programming is a computational approach where multiple processes or threads execute tasks simultaneously to solve a problem faster and more efficiently.
- Instead of performing operations sequentially (one at a time), parallel programming divides the workload into smaller tasks that ==run concurrently across multiple processors or computing units.==


> [!SUMMARY] Tip
> In parallel processes, always running the longest task first, to reduce the overall execution time

### Why is Parallel Programming Useful?

- **Speed and Performance**: by executing multiple operations simultaneously, parallel programming reduces execution time, making it ideal for handling large-scale computations (e.g., simulations, big data processing, AI training).
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: modern CPUs and GPUs have multiple cores; parallel programming allows leveraging these resources effectively
- **Scalability**: in distributed systems (e.g., cloud computing, supercomputers), workloads can be divided across many machines, improving efficiency as the system scales
- **Solving Complex Problems**: many scientific, engineering, and AI tasks require high computational power, which would be infeasible with traditional sequential computing

### Limitations of Parallel Programming

- **Synchronization Overhead**: coordinating multiple processes requires extra effort, leading to overhead in data sharing and communication.
- **Complexity**: writing parallel programs is more challenging than sequential programming due to race conditions, deadlocks, and debugging difficulties
- **Not all problems are parallelizable**: some tasks are inherently sequential (e.g., dependent calculations) and cannot be efficiently parallelized ==(Amdahlâ€™s Law)==
- **Hardware Constraints**: Performance gains depend on the hardware capabilities (number of cores, memory bandwidth). Over-parallelization can lead to diminishing returns
- **Data Consistency Issues**: in shared-memory models, ensuring data consistency and avoiding conflicts requires careful management (e.g., locks, atomic operations).
