## Definition

The White Box Test method is the one that looks at the code and structure of the product to be tested and uses that knowledge to perform the tests. This method is used in the [[unit testing ]]phase, although it can also occur in other stages such as [[integration testing]] ones. For the execution of this method, the tester or the person who will use this method ==must have extensive knowledge of the technology used to develop the program.==

**Key features:**
- it takes in consideration unique characteristics of a software
- it is carried out by software developers who have an extensive knowledge of the codebase
- used in unit testing or integration testing
- more time consuming than the [[black-box testing]]
- the focus is on the software logic
- it is suitable for algorithm testing

Also known as: *clear box testing, code-based testing, structural testing, transparent testing*
