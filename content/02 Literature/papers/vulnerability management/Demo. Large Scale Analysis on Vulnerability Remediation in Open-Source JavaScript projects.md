## Context

The security of a software project relies not only on the success of the vulnerability discovery but also on the success of the vulnerability remediation
- multiple commits are needed to fix a vulnerability and not all fixes completely solve the issue 

**Proposal**
**Demo**: a novel tool to automatically analyze commits responsible for introducing or to fix vulnerabilities. The proposal is language agnostic

**Results**
90% of the 130 projects analyzed include commits that introduce new vulnerabilities 1 out of 6 times instead of fixing one
- 78% of these introduced vulnerabilities ==could have been prevented if the developer used a scanning/analyzing tool==

## Approach

Describe the paper approach in simple term.
