## What is MALAI

Malai is an architectural [[design pattern]] that aims at fitting the growing evolution of software interactivity. Malai gathers principles of several major interaction models and design patterns, notably the: 
- instrumental interaction
- [[direct manipulation (design pattern)]]
- Command
- [[Memento (design pattern)]]

Compared to the [[MVW (model-view-controller)]] architectural design pattern, Malai refines the controller to consider the notion of interactions, actions, and instruments as first-class objects. 

With dedicated tools, Malai can be used as a [[UIDL (User Interface Description Language)]].
