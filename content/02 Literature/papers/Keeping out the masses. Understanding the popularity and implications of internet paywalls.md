Goals of the paper:
- measuring how widely paywalls have been adopted
- present an automated system for detecting whether a site uses a paywall

The web is increasingly moving away from “open” models to “paywalled” models (see [[paywalls]]), to keep the user engaged with the platform.

People are annoyed by ad-based websites because:
- Google and Facebook have a monopoly on the advertising industry (70% of revenues)
- Ad-based funding systems suffer from significant and increasing rates of fraud
- privacy concerns

### Paywall circumvention

We find that all observed paywalls are trivial to circumvent. Well-known techniques includes:
- changing the screen size dimensions
- hiding the user’s IP address
- changing the user agent string
- using an ad blocker extension
- enabling “Reader Mode”
- using the Pocket web service5
- enabling Incognito/Private Mode
- emptying the cookie jar
- blocking HTTP requests for popular paywall libraries
