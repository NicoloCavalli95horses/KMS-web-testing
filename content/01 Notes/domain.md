## Definition

Domain names serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services, with a ==text-based label that is easier to memorize ==than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols.

A domain name may represent entire collections of such resources or individual instances.
- Individual Internet host computers use domain names as host identifiers, also called **hostnames**
- The term hostname is also used for the leaf labels in the domain name system, usually without further subordinate domain name space

Hostnames appear as a component in Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for Internet resources such as websites (e.g., en.wikipedia.org).
