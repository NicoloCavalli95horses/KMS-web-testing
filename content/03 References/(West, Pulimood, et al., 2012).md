With the exponential growth of Internet use, web applications are becoming increasingly popular: they are easy to distribute, simple to update, and widely accessible. However, a uniform programming method for developing web applications does not currently exist. Developers must be experts in and juggle a combination of different languages in order to create fully functional web applications. W3C's introduction of HTML5 attempts to alleviate this problem [8]. Their Web Storage specification offers a method for storing client-side data as an alternative to the use of cookies in web applications. In this paper, the Web Storage specification is analyzed through an in-depth discussion of the privacy, security, and performance of current and future web technologies. The advantages and disadvantages of the localStorage and sessionStorage attributes are discussed, with special consideration given to their impact on privacy and security. Analysis is done in the context of a custom web application, offering a suggested framework for applications utilizing HTML5 Web Storage.}, journal = {J. Comput. Sci.
