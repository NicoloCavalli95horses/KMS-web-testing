## Context

Client-side validation ease the web server work and improve the user experience. But when the web server fails to replicate the client-side validation, the application is exposed to parameter tampering attacks.
- HTTP requests can indeed be crafted by hand to circumvent client-side checks
- a web application can be said as vulnerable to parameter tampering *when the server-side parameter validation is weaker than the client-side* validation

The correct way to check user input is to ==duplicate the checks, or to perform even stricter validation on the server side==

**Contributions**
- a fully automated system to identify validation-related vulnerabilities on the server-side, with a mechanism to confirm these vulnerabilities
- missing checks on the server-side are identified by analyzing the client-side code, *which is used to extract part of the specifications of the desired behavior* of the system
- WAPTEC (Whitebox Analysis for Parameter Tampering Exploit Construction) combine techniques from formal logic and constraint solving, symbolic evaluation and dynamic program analysis to identify missing checks on the server-side

**Challenges**
- often a *web server uses a different logic* to validate the user input (e.g., the client-side accept a string of length `<=` 10, the server-side accept whatever length but drop each character after the 10th)
- the client-side does not consider database constraints, therefore these constraints has to be integrated server-side
- parameter tampering also implies an attacker guessing new parameters to achieve specific goals. Therefore, new checks should be integrated server-side that are not directly derivable from the client (e.g., an attacker could append a parameter `discount` hoping to trigger a specific server response)

## Approach



## Evaluation

Six open source web application were evaluated
- 45 previously unknown vulnerabilities were discovered

## Limits

- The proposed solution works on the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
