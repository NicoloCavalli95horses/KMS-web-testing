## Definition

Phishing attacks ==manipulate the user with the goal of stealing confidential information== (login credentials, payment card details, etc)

**Why people still fall for phishing?**
The average user:
- is unable to distinguish malicious web pages from legitimate ones
- does not have enough technical information about URLs, so:
	- does not know which URL to trust (for example: embedded in e-mail text, in a displayed tooltip, in the status bar)
	- does not see the whole URL of a web page, due to tiny URL services
- clicks on links without checking, for an habituation effect
