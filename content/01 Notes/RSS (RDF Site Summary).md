## Definition

*RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication)* is a web feed that ==allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.==
- Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitors sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them

News aggregators (or "RSS readers") can be built into a browser, installed on a desktop computer, or installed on a mobile device.

Websites usually use RSS feeds to:
- publish frequently updated information, such as blog entries, news headlines, episodes of audio and video series,
- distributing podcasts

> [!SUMMARY]
> An RSS document includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author's name. RSS formats are specified using a generic XML file

Although RSS formats have evolved from as early as March 1999, it was between 2005 and 2006 when RSS gained widespread use.
