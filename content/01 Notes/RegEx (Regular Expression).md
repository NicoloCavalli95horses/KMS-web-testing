## Definition

A RegEx (regular expression) is a ==sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text. ==
- Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation
- Regular expression techniques are developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory
- Even if most of the RegEx implementation are shared among the most programming languages, advanced syntax could vary from language to language
