## Context

According to the form of attack, malicious web pages are mainly divided into two categories: [[phishing]] pages and malware downloads (see [[drive-by downloads]])
## Approach

- CSS features can be exploited to hide the hidden [[redirect attack]] page, avoid visual effects and increasing the probability of escape
- a number of CSS features have been selected as target in hidden redirect scenarios
- a [[machine learning]] model has been trained to identify the presence of these features in a list of websites and it is able to detect whether the website is dangerous
