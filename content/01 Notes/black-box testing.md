## Definition

Black Box Testing is the method that does not consider the internal structure, design, and product implementation to be tested. In other words, the tester does not know its internal functioning. The Black Box only evaluates the external behavior of the system. The inputs received by the system and the outputs or responses it produces are tested.

**Key features:**
- considers only external behavior
- carried out by testers (with an end-user perspective)
- no need to have knowledge on specific programming languages or implementation details
- it exposes ambiguities or inconsistencies in the requirements specifications
- used in system testing or [[acceptance testing]]
- less time consuming compared to [[white-box testing]]
- it focuses on the behavior of the system
- it is not suitable for algorithms testing

Also known as: *data-driven testing, functional testing, closed-box testing*
