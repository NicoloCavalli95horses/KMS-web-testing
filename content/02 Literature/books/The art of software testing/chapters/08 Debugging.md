**Debugging** is the process of correcting a software after one or more test cases has found errors.

**Brute force methods**:
Debugging ==with a storage dump== (a crude display of all storage locations in hexadecimal or octal format)

Debugging ==using print/console commands== 
- does not encourage you to think about the program
- it is a hit-or-miss method
- it requires to change the program and those changes may mask the error, alter critical timing relationships or introduce new errors

Debugging with ==automated debugging tools==
