## Definition

Similar to:  [[EFG (event flow graph)]], it describe the events net a GUI but it puts more focus on the sequences and the dependences.

First, the possible events are extracted from the GUI:

![[event_sequence_graph.png]]

Then, an event flow graph is create, abstracting away the interface details:

![[event_flow_graph 1.png]]

All the valid sequences are identifies:

![[event_sequences.png]]

The test sequences are logically inferred (since a test cannot start on e4, a step back is required)

Also called: GUI-based scenarios

### Applications

- automated testing
- creating app usage documentation

### Techniques

Event sequences can be generated by relying on:
- [[static analysis]]
- [[dynamic analysis]]
- [[symbolic execution]]
- [[concolic execution]]
- execution traces
- manually definitions made by programmers
- random chains of events without any knowledge of the app (e.g. Android UI Monkey)

### Classification of infeasible events sequences

- **disabled**: a [[standard widgets]] or [[ad hoc widgets]] of the GUI is always disabled and that event cannot be reached from the detected event sequence (e.g., the user is not allowed to access a premium functionality of an app)
- **required**: an functionality is disabled/locked if a certain action is not execute before. Some event needs another event to be executed before it is enabled
- **consecutive**: two events cannot be executed at the same time, because they are mutually exclusive
- **excluded**: similar to the consecutive one, it occurs when enabling the first event causes the second one to disable, and there is no way to change this state even manipulation all the other events available
