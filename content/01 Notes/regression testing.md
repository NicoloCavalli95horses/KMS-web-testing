## Definition

Regression Testing is the testing of software ==after changes has been made==; this testing is done to make sure that the reliability of each software release, testing after changes has been made to ensure that changes did not introduce any new errors into the system and that previous functionalities are maintained.

Regression test minimization (RTM), regression test selection (RTS) and test-case prioritization (TCP) are three fundamental techniques for selecting test cases to execute in a regression testing.
- test cases considered redundant or almost identical will be removed
- least useful tests may be discarded
