Moreover, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of the efficacy of current accessibility testing tools. To address this gap, we present the first mutation analysis framework, called Ma11y, designed to assess web accessibility testing tools. Ma11y includes 25 mutation operators that intentionally violate various accessibility principles and an automated oracle to determine whether a mutant is detected by a testing tool. Evaluation on real-world websites demonstrates the practical applicability of the mutation operators and the framework’s capacity to assess tool performance. Our results demonstrate that the current tools cannot identify nearly 50\% of the accessibility bugs injected by our framework, thus underscoring the need for the development of more effective accessibility testing tools. Finally, the framework’s accuracy and performance attest to its potential for seamless and automated application in practical settings.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 33rd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis}, pages = {100–111}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {Mutation Testing, Software Accessibility, Web}, location = {Vienna, Austria}, series = {ISSTA 2024} }
