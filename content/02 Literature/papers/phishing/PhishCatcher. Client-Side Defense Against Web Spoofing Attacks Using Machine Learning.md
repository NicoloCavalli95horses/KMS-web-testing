## Context

A [[phishing]] attack occurred in Oct 2022 at INRIA: a fake login page under a credible URL was used to steal the credentials of researchers and students

**Contributions**
- a client-side anti-phishing mechanism based on machine learning is proposed and a Chrome extension is implemented

## Approach
- dataset was taken from 4 different resources (UCI Machine Learning Repository, collection of 90 hijacked journal websites, 310 blacklisted URLs from PhishTank, 310 genuine URLs from moz.com/top500)
## Evaluation

Often a tool or a solution is implemented. How was that solution evaluated?

## Results

Describe the results in simple terms

## Limits

What are the limits of the research? What could be improved?
