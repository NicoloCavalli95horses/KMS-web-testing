## Definition

|          | Value                       |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| Duration | 90-120 min                  |
| People   | 3-5 people                  |
| Pace     | 100-150 statements per hour |

Similarly to the [[code inspection]], a team is constituted. The author of the code, a moderator and a skilled tester should be present. Other people that may be involved:
- a programming-language expert,
- a new programmer (to give a fresh, unbiased outlook),
- someone from a different project,
- someone from the same programming team as the programmer

The main difference from [[code inspection]] is that the participants **play computer**
- a set of test cases is mentally executed. The test data are walked through the logic of the program
- the expected state is monitored on paper or whiteboard
- this inputs serve as a vehicle for getting started and for questioning the author's choices
