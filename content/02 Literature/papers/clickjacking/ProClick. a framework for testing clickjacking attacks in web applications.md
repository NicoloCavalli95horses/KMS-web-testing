## Context

[[clickjacking]] attacks allure users to click on objects transparently placed in malicious web pages. The resultant actions of the click operation may cause unwanted operations in the legitimate websites without the knowledge of users

## Approach

Describe the research approach in simple terms. What did the authors do to solve the problem?

## Evaluation

*ProClick* was evaluated
- on 100 legitimate websites from Alexa
- on a set of 6 malicious websites created ad-hoc (no reliable dataset of malicious websites was found for clickjacking)

Low false positive rates
