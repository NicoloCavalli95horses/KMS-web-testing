[[client-side tampering]] leverage on client-side manipulation to get access to protected resources or execute functions in an unauthorized way. Logical flaws present in the codebase can also be exploited.

A simple representation of the application logic is sufficient to perform automated reasoning and to generate test cases that are likely to expose the presence of logic vulnerabilities. ==By analyzing the network traffic generated by user interacting with a certain application's functionality, heuristics can be applied to infer the underlying application logic, sufficient precision==

The targets of this study are ==e-commerce== web application

**Contributions**

1) We introduce a new black-box technique to test applications for logic vulnerabilities
2) We present the implementation of a tool and we show how the tool can be used to test several real web applications, even with a very limited knowledge and a small number of network traces
3) We discover ten previously-unknown vulnerabilities in well-known and largely deployed web applications. Most of these vulnerabilities have a very high impact and would allow an attacker to buy online for free from hundreds of thousands of online stores

**Using HTTP conversations to build a model of the application**
- analyzing the HTTP conversation is a passive black-box method to create a model of the application. Accessing the source code or crawling the pages is not required
- the traces are manually generated by the user, that interact with the application
- for simplicity, the pattern that has been studied is the following: 
	- logging in
	- adding items to the shopping cart
	- checking out
- other functionalities could be studied as well, but the payment process is one of the most relevant part of the business logic
- traces are collected from the client, which communicate with multiple servers (usually, the web server that handle the store, and the web server responsible for the payment, which is often a third-party service)
- the HTTP conversation is used to create a model of the application:
	- **resource abstraction**: an abstract HTML page is created considering URLS, POST data, DOM paths
