## Main concepts

Most of the modern test techniques will check for [[error]], fails, crashes or exceptions, but sometimes a bug is not an error but unexpected and confusing “functional” response of the system (see [[principle of least astonishment]])

- For example, a sign-in form that, if the user submit with already registered data, will trigger two warning to the user, such as “account already existent” and “successfully logged”
- In this case, no errors or exceptions are triggered but the system behaviour is not functional

## Augusto: AUtomatic GUi Semantic Testing and Oracles

This technique leverage on common sense knowledge to ==automatically generate semantically-relevant test cases equipped with functional oracles that can reveal hidden faults.==

- the idea is to generate test case with useful combinations of actions, and not random sequences of actions
- detect failures that depend on the semantic of the application

> The intuition is that *many popular functionalities are implemented in similar ways and shall respond in similar ways*

[[AIF (Application Independent Functionalities)]] (common sense knowledge)

- examples of AIF are CRUD operations, search and booking operations

Relying on common problem and common expectations means *specify tests once for all* and *automatically adapt and reuse* them

Augusto method is complementary to other automatic technique, allowing the developer to address more specific functionalities using other approaches.
