## Definition

NAS devices (Network Attached Storage devices) are network-connected storage devices designed to provide centralized access to data and files by multiple clients over a local area network (LAN) or even the Internet.

### What are NAS

- NAS is a small specialized computer with its own operating system (often Linux-based), built-in hard drives, and network connectivity
- It exposes files through protocols such as SMB/CIFS (used by Windows), NFS (used by Unix/Linux), or FTP, SFTP, or WebDAV
- It can have a web interface accessible via browser

Uploading a file into the NAS can be done using a public directory (the LaCie, for example, has a public ftp directory available by default) via the FTP or SMB protocols.
