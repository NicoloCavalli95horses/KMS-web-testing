## Definition

Typosquatting, also called URL hijacking, a sting site, a cousin domain, or a fake URL, is a form of cybersquatting, and possibly brandjacking which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser.

A user accidentally entering an incorrect website address may be led to any URL, ==including an alternative website owned by a cyber-squatter.==

The typosquatter's URL will usually be similar to the victim's site address; the typosquatting site could be in the form of:
- A misspelling, or foreign language spelling, of the intended site
- A misspelling based on a typographical error
- A plural of a singular domain name
- A different top-level domain (e.g., .com instead of .org) (see [[top-level navigation]])
- An abuse of the Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) (.cm, .co, or .om instead of .com)

### Similar abuses
- **Combosquatting** – no misspelling, but appending an arbitrary word that appears legitimate, but that anyone could register.
- **Doppelganger domain** – omitting a period or inserting an extra period
- Appending terms such as sucks or -suckes to a domain name

Once on the typosquatter's site, ==the user may also be tricked into thinking that they are actually on the real site through the use of copied or similar logos, website layouts, or content.== Spam emails sometimes make use of typosquatting URLs to trick users into visiting malicious sites that look like a given bank's site, for instance
