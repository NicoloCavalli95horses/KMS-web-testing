## Definition

**Paywalls**  are a broad term for ==monetization systems where visitors are charged subscription fees to access site content, sometimes after being able to sample a small amount of content for free.==

The upsides of paywall systems:
- they promise to enable the continued creation of high-quality content

Risks and implications of walled web:
- reducing societal access to news and information
- [[privacy]] harms of the increased user tracking needed to enforce paywalls (the engagement of the user with the platform is tracked: how much time the user spend on the platform, how many article he reads, etc)
- paywall may introduce a class system on the web, where high-quality content is reserved to rich people

Google, Facebook and Apple, build platforms to provide or support paywall services

### Types of paywalls

**Hard paywalls**: the subscription is required before visitor can access the content (e.g., Netflix business model)

**Soft or metered paywalls**: a freemium business model is implemented, where free contents are combined with premium content, or where all the content is available but for a short amount of time
- in most of these scenario, a ==JavaScript snippet measure either the number of articles a user has accessed or the time a user spends in browsing the website's content==

### Paywall prevalence and distribution

![[paywall_prevalence.png]]
- **Site types**: news content (80.3%)
- **Country**: US, Australia, France, Canada, Germany (the most expensive paywalls are also in Germany)
- **Popularity of paywalled-websites**: only 8.54% of paywall-using sites are among the 10,000 most popular sites on the web

> [!WARNING] Paywall providers: risks of a monopoly
> A significant number of sites rely on third-parties for their paywall implementation. Most popular paywall-as-a-service: Piano (23.5%) and Tecnavia (21%). This monopoly is significant because:
> - affect amount of income content-makers can receive
> - make large scale bypass easier
> - [[privacy]] implication in having a small number of providers tracking users

**Prevalence of paywalls types**:
- soft paywalls (66.7%)
- hard paywalls (15.6%)
- hybrid approach (16.6%): [[machine learning]] is used to classify an article as locked, or not

**Enforcement mechanism**
- truncating article text
- obfuscating the article with popups
- redirecting users to a subscription page (less frequent, 7.3%)

**Effects on the UX**
Users view less pages on paywalled sites, stay for shorter periods of time and link to pages less. Interestingly, we did not see a significantly difference
to the bounce rate between paywalled and non-paywalled sites

> People do not generally receive a tracker free version of site content when paying for subscriptions. Instead, paywall systems seem to serve as an additional monetization mechanism on top of existing, [[privacy]] harming, ad systems
