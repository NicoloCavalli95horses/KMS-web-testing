## Definition
The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of [[DOS (Denial of Service)]] attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression (Regex) to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.
