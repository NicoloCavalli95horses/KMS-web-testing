## What is RBAC (role-based access control)

RBAC is a foundational principle in cyber security that helps organizations to manage and control access to their critical resources. It implies ==diversify the access to the resources based on roles and permissions.==

**Mapping users to roles, and roles to permissions**
 At its core, RBAC operates on the principle of assigning permissions to roles, rather than to individual users
 - Users should only have access to the information and the resources necessary for their roles *(principle of least privilege)*

## Components of RBAC

**Roles**: roles represent different job functions or responsibilities within an organization. These roles are defined based on the tasks and the access requirements of various users.
- For example, in a healthcare setting, roles may include doctors, nurses, administrators or patients. Each role is associated with specific permissions that dictate what actions users in that role can perform.

**Permissions**: permissions define the actions or operations that users are allowed to perform within a system or application. These permissions can include tasks such as read, write, execute, delete and modify. Permissions are assigned to roles based on the access requirements of each role.
- For instance, a doctor role may have permissions to view patient records and prescribe medications, while a nurse role may only have permissions to view patient records and administer medications.

**Users**: users are individuals who are assigned to specific roles within an organization. Each user is associated with *one or more roles based on their job responsibilities*. By assigning users to roles, organizations can effectively manage access to resources and ensure that users only have access to the information and functionalities necessary for their roles.
