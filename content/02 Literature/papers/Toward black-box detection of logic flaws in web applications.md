[[client-side tampering]] leverage on client-side manipulation to get access to protected resources or execute functions in an unauthorized way. Logical flaws present in the codebase can also be exploited.

A simple representation of the application logic is sufficient to perform automated reasoning and to generate test cases that are likely to expose the presence of logic vulnerabilities. ==By analyzing the network traffic generated by user interacting with a certain application's functionality, heuristics can be applied to infer the underlying application logic, with enough precision==

The targets of this study are e-commerce web application

### Contributions

1) We introduce a new black-box technique to test applications for logic vulnerabilities
2) We present the implementation of a tool and we show how the tool can be used to test several real web applications, even with a very limited knowledge and a small number of network traces
3) We discover ten previously-unknown vulnerabilities in well-known and largely deployed web applications. Most of these vulnerabilities have a very high impact and would allow an attacker to buy online for free from hundreds of thousands of online stores
