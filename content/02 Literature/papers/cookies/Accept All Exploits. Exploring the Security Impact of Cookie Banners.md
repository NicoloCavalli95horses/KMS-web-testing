## Context

[[cookie]] banners prompt users for giving the consent for processing identification data. This large-scale study proves that user who consents to tracking executes 45% more third-party scripts and is exposed to 63% more security sensitive data flows on average. More than 1/3 of the scripts executed after the consent has been given are vulnerably to [[XSS (cross site scripting)]].
- ==who consent to cookies is browsing a much more insecure and dangerous version of the same website==

**Exploiting cookie banners**
While cookie banners are supposed to give the user control over their personal data, ==they often employ dark patterns to lure users into giving as much consent as possible, or overwhelm them with complicated choices==

The hypothesis is that if data collection requires consent by the user, the corresponding code carrying out that collection should only be executed once consent is given. Thus, providing consent via a cookie banner dialog will increase the attack surface of a websiteâ€™s JavaScript code and lead to a reduction in security.

### Contributions
- A methodology to automatically accept cookie dialogs, thereby maximizing the consent given for tracking
- A study over the European web landscape, measuring the effects of accepting a banner with a focus on additionally loaded and executed code
- An analysis on the security impact of cookie banners based on the increase of dangerous taint flows and [[XSS (cross site scripting)]] vulnerabilities after giving consent
