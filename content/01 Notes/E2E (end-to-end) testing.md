## Definition

E2E (end-to-end) testing is a type of [[black-box testing]] that aims to test a system as a whole, as a human tester would. It generally involves a sequence of actions (test scenario) performed on the GUI to access the correctness of a particular feature.

Similar to [[usability testing]] but the focus is on the correctness of the user flows (e.g., can the user performe a purchase correctly? are data stored in the database as expected?)

In web testing, several E2E testing tools are commonly used:
- Selenium WebDriver
- Puppeteer
- Cypress
