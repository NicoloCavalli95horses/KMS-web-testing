## Definition

Firefox, one of the more popular browsers, is extensible through an elaborate extension system. Firefox extensions are built around so called XPCOM components. 

XPCOM (cross platform component object model), has multiple language bindings, enabling components written in different languages to be transparently integrated as a Firefox extension.

The component interfaces are defined in XPIDL, a language-neutral interface definition language.
- Next to a number of built-in core components, the Mozilla foundation itself provides a lot of XPCOM components.
