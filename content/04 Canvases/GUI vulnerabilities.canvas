It arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the response in an unsafe way.\n- **Stored**: malicious inputs are stored in databases, message forums, comments fields of the attacked server. The malicious code is executed by visiting users. This is the most dangerous XSS attack\n- **DOM-based**: executed on the client-side. Attackers are able to exploit client-side logic that process data from untrusted sources-end to collect sensitive information from the users. ==It is the  less studied type of XSS==\n### Detection and mitigation\n- Static analysis:  [[static taint analysis]], [[symbolic execution]], string analysis, [[GA (genetic algorithm)]], [[program slicing]], data flow analysis, [[precise alias analysis]]\n- Dynamic analysis: [[black-box testing]]. [[taint tracking]], flow analysis, monitoring, filtering\n### Risks and issues\n- Steal sensitive information\n- Hijack a user's account\n- Manipulate the web content\n- Cause a [[DoS (Denial of Service)]]\n\n## Possible research paths\n- Improve detection and mitigation techniques\n\n## Papers\n- [[ref_current_state_research_xss]]\n- [[ref_common_vulnerabilities_real_world_web_application]]\n\n## CVEs\n","x":-3800,"y":484,"width":785,"height":1756},

Each request may be different in contents and origins (e.g., different IP addresses are used and different input are used)\n - **Stored**: an attacker stores malicious input to the vulnerable web server (e.g., a comment in a blog). The malicious content is fetched and matched against a vulnerable RegEx (e.g., there is an illegal-content detector). Since the malicious input is stored, each new user of the blog could potentially read that malicious input, which is public, and each time a new ReDoS attack could be triggered\n\n## Possible research paths\n- Improve detection and mitigation techniques\n\n## Papers\n- [[ref_runtime_recovery_web_app_under_redos]]\n\n## CVEs","x":-2970,"y":484,"width":687,"height":1756},
