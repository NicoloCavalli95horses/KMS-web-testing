## Definition
 
 Combinatorial testing is a testing method that uses multiple combinations of input parameters to perform testing for a software application.
 
> The main goal of combinatorial testing is to make sure that the software product can handle different combinations of test data as input parameters and configuration options. 

Testers use combinatorial testing techniques, such as [[CA (covering array)]], based on the idea that defects in a software application can occur by specific combinations of input parameters rather than by isolated inputs.
- By focusing on the ==input combinations== like that, the testers can provide effective test coverage while reducing the number of test cases written. 

### Benefits

- Covers a broad range of input combinations using a minimum number of test cases
- Increases test coverage compared to normal component testing since it always considers multiple input combinations
- Helps to detect [[error]], bugs, fails, [[CVE (common vulnerabilities and exposures)]], and unexpected outputs that might not be detected during the usual component and [[regression testing]] phases
- Reduces testing effort, cost, and time, since combinatorial tests use fewer test cases to cover a wide scope of testing
- Identifies issues ==at the earliest== while allowing the team to address and fix those earlier in the software development life cycle
- Optimizes the testing process by removing unwanted test cases while ensuring that the cost and effort are not wasted on repeating the same test scenarios again and again
- Helps to test complex software applications with a large number of parameters, settings, and options
- Reduces the risk of critical defects going unnoticed, which can occur only when handling specific input combinations.
