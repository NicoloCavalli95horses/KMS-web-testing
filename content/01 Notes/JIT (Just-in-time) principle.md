## Definition

The JIT (just-in-time) principle is a dynamic access model where ==privileges are granted only when needed, and for a limited time==
- this principle helps reduce the window of exposure where excessive privileges could be exploited

### Example

A system administrator may receive temporary elevated privileges to configure a server but loses access after a specific time or upon task completion
