## Context

[[EAR (Execution After Redirect)]] is a redirect vulnerability where *unintended code is executed and sent to the user* after a redirect. EARs are technically logic flaws
## Approach

- We developed a black-box classification system to detect different types of EAR vulnerabilities by analyzing the HTTP response
- large-scale analysis to determine the prevalence of EARs on the Internet
- crawled 8,097,283 URLs from 255,957 domains and found ==2173 security critical EARs among 416 domains==

### Detecting EAR

For an HTTP response to indicate an EAR vulnerability, two things are needed:
- the response must be an HTTP redirect response
- the HTTP redirect response content must divulge confidential information about the web application

**Distinguish between vulnerable and legitimate HTTP redirect response**
- legitimate responses are often empty or simply report the current HTML of the page
- string patterns that match text commonly used in legitimate redirections can be used
- pattern are recognizable because HTTP redirect responses often respect rules
### Classification of non-EARs

- **generic redirect**: the content of a redirect message aims to warn a user of a changed location
- **irrelevant or broken content**: here is a bit of information but it is not sensitive or relevant
- **near duplicate**: the HTTP body returned is similar to the content of the redirect location's content. A [[NCD (Normalized Compression Distance)]] is used to calculate the textual similarity

### Classification of EARs

- **[[error]] message**: some content sent by the server contains [[error]] messages, which ==can reveal sensitive information about the web server (paths of the server, which can be used in [[directory traversal (path traversal)]] attacks, details about the framework, the language and often the version number, SQL query syntax details, which can lead to [[SQLIA (SQL injection attack)]])==
- **HTTPS redirect**: HTTP redirect response contains a full web page and the redirect leads to a page served through a secure channel. This is a security-critical EAR because, ==by redirecting to a secure channel, the web application is signaling that the content is sensitive==. These EARs most likely contain sensitive information or information that should not be available to unauthorized users
- **Pre-login access**: HTTP redirect response redirect to a login page, ==but the body of the HTTP message include the content of the page, even though the user is not authenticated.== This is a authentication bypass.
	- In a case, a social platform had a EAR that allowed anyone to access a user's profile, violating user's [[privacy]]
- **Transparent barrier**: web application developers sometimes want the user to visit a certain page prior to allowing access to the full content of the web application. For example the user is redirected to the same page until she has “signed” a Terms of Use form.
	- in this cases, sometimes developers set a redirection but keep the old web application version in the HTTP body
- **Other**: body content not included in the previous categories

The classification follows a ==progressive and ordered approach,== meaning that the HTTP response is categorized on the last category whose criteria are met (if a response matches the criteria for pre-login, it is not classified as near duplicate even if both criteria are met)
