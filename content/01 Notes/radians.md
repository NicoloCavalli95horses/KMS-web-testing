## Main concepts

Radian is a unit used to measure angles. In a circle, a radian is simply the angle we get when the ray is equivalent to the arc (a segment of the circumference).

This angle is often useful in [[Linear Algebra]] when we need to consider element located clock-like.

Radian angle is often used in combination with [[sine and cosine]] functions to get the position of elements disposed on a circumference.
