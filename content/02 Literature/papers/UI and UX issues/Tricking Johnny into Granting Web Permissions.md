## Context

In a [[clickjacking]] attack, an attacker tricks a user into clicking on webpage element that is hidden or disguised as another element. This can result in a situation in which the user takes an action unwittingly

This study aims at answering to the following RQ: *How can the web permission dialog box be abused, and how effective are the existing preventive measures in browsers?”*
## Approach

- designed an experimental game, called “Furious Clicker,” to evaluate whether or not users can be tricked into granting webcam permission by clicking on the 'allow' button of the web permission API’s dialog box
- We asked 120 participants to take part in our web-based game experiment
- We conducted three experiments, each with 40 different participants, on both desktop and mobile browsers
- We used the mobile version of Google Chrome on Android, and the desktop version of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome on Mac OS

## Results

- 95% of participants were tricked on a ==mobile browser==
- 72% on a ==desktop browser==
- 47% of participants on a desktop browser ==where a prevention mechanism exists==
