## Definition

In computing, a sink, or data sink generally refers to the ==destination of data flow==

The word sink has multiple uses in computing:
- In software engineering, an event sink is a class or function that receives events from another object or function
- In cyber security, a **sink function** is a target function, maybe a vulnerable one, that receives an user's input and does not check it properly
