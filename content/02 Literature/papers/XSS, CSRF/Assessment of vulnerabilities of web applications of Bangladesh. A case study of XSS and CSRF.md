## Context

The central bank of Bangladesh known as Bangladesh Bank lost $100 million due to cyberattacks such as [[XSS (cross site scripting)]] and [[CSRF (cross-site request forgery)]]
## Approach

Unsystematic and short literature review. The authors claim to have studied 335 web applications, but it is unclear (i) which application was chosen and why, (ii) how XSS and CSRF were detected in these applications
