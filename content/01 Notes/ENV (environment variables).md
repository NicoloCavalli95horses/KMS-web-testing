## Definition

An environment variable is a user-definable value that ==can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer==. Environment variables are part of the environment in which a process runs.
- For example, a running process can query the value of the TEMP environment variable to discover a suitable location to store temporary files, or the HOME or USERPROFILE variable to find the directory structure owned by the user running the process.
