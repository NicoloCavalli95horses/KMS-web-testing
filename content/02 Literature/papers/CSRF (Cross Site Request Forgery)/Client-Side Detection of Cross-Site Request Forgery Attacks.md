## Context

In practice, [[CSRF (cross-site request forgery)]] attacks are mounted on top of [[XSS (cross site scripting)]] vulnerabilities.
- An XSS vulnerability allows one to inject arbitrary HTML or JS code
- JS code or HTML specific attribute values with arbitrary URLs perform then unexpected activities

## Approach
