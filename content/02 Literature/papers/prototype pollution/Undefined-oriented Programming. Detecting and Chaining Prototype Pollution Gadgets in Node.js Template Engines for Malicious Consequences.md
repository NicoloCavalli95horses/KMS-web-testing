## Context

[[prototype pollution]] allows an adversary to contaminate a property of a prototypical object in JavaScript, which further alters the vulnerable program’s logic for the adversary’s purpose.

In this paper, we design and implement the first automated framework, called Undefined-oriented Programming Framework (UOPF), to detect and chain [[prototype pollution gadgets]] for malicious consequences via concolic execution of JavaScript programs with undefined properties as symbols.

**Contributions**
- we propose UoPF (Undefined oriented Programming Framework), to detect direct and chained gadgets
- we curated the first gadget dataset
