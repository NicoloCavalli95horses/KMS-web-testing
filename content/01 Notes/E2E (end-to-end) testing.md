## Definition

E2E (end-to-end) testing is a type of [[black-box testing]] that aims to test a system as a whole, as a human tester would. It generally involves a sequence of actions performed on the GUI to access the correctness of a particular feature.

In web testing, several E2E testing tools are commonly used:
- Selenium WebDriver
- Puppeteer
- Cypress
