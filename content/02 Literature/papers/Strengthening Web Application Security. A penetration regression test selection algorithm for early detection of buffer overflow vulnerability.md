## Abstract

[[regression testing]] ensures that recent changes to code haven't affected the application's already existing functionalities. This approach is used widely in functional testing but not addressed enough in the context of penetration or security testing.
This paper proposes:
- novel algorithm for penetration regression test selection
- extended branch coverage criteria with a focus on [[buffer overflow]] vulnerability

## Introduction

Web application are susceptible to a surplus of security vulnerabilities:
- insufficient input validation
- weak authentication procedures
- data not adequately encrypted
- patching software at a low rate
- buffer overflow vulnerability

In buffer overflow vulnerability, the program attempts to write additional data into a buffer that does not fit the input. In these cases, data overflow into neighboring memory locations might occur. ==This can be the cause to data corruption, crashes, code injection and execution, privilege escalation.==
