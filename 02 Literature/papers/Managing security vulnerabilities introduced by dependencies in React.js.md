## Main concepts

Third-party packages offer several benefits to the application development, but comes also with challenges and security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have been studied mostly in the context of the hosting software ecosystem (e.g., npm package).

JavaScript popularity is due to:
- enabling interactive, real-time, on-demand responses to the end user
- large support for most of programming paradigms
- weakly typed and beginner friendly
- lots of frameworks and large community support

Risks associated to third party dependencies:
- since JS is loosely coupled, security flaws are common
- [[DOS (Denial of Service)]]
- [[prototype pollution]] issues
