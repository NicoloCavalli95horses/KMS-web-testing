A decision table is a concise visual representation for specifying which output/actions to perform depending on given conditions. It is a [[black-box testing]] technique.

 There are two varieties of decision table:
- ==a limited-entry decision table==: the condition alternatives are simple boolean values, and the actions are check-marks
- ==an extended-entry decision table==: no constraints on cells values
