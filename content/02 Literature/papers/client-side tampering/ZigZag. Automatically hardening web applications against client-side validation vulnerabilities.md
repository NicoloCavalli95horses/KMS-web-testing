## Context

The growth of the JavaScript ecosystem has created a shift in business logic from the backend to the client side. This created also new attack opportunities:
- [[C2C (client-to-client) communication]] can be exploited to get access to sensitive information
- client-side validation flaws are closely tied to the intended behavior of the system. Therefore, they are hard to identify

Some of these attacks are completely invisible to the server
