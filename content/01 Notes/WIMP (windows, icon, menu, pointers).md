### What is WIMP?

WIMP is a collection of a GUI elements/widgets, that is often cited in GUIs related issues or bugs.

- **Windows**: In this context, a window is a rectangular area on the screen that displays content from a single application. Each window can function independently, allowing users to work on multiple tasks at once.
- **Icons**: Icons are small graphical representations of programs or files. By clicking or double-clicking them, users can execute commands or open files and applications.
- **Menus**: Menus provide a list of options or commands that a user can choose from. They are usually displayed in a bar at the top of the screen or within individual windows.
- **Pointers**: Pointers, often in the shape of an arrow, are controlled by a mouse or touchpad. They allow users to select and interact with items on the screen via input devices.

Collectively, these elements create a visual and intuitive environment for users to interact with their computer systems. They allow users to execute commands, navigate through files, and manage their tasks without needing to memorize complex command-line instructions.
