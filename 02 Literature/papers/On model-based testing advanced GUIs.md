## Abstract

GUI design is currently shifting from designing GUIs composed of [[standard widgets]] to designing GUIs relying on more natural interactions and [[ad hoc widgets]].  
This shift is meant to support the advent of GUIs providing users with more adapted and natural interactions, and the support of new input devices such as multi-touch screens with [[multi-modal interactions]].

Standard widgets (e.g. buttons) are more and more replaced by ad hoc ones (e.g. the drawing area of graphical editors), and interactions are shifting from [[mono-event interaction]] (e.g. button pressures) to [[multi-event interactions ]](e.g. multi-touch and gesture-based
interactions). 

As a consequence, the current GUI model-based testing approaches, which target event-based systems, show their limits when applied to test such new advanced GUIs. The work introduced in this paper establishes the following contributions:
- a precise analysis of these limits (1)
- a proposition to tackle the identified limits by leveraging the Malai GUI specification language and by proposing the concept of interaction-action-flow graph
- feedback from two use cases
- an industrial project and an open-source application, where the proposed approach has been applied.

**1. Limits of traditional testing frameworks**

### Main concepts

==In GUI testing, test models are mainly [[EFG (event flow graph)]]. Test scripts can be are automatically generated by traversing an EFG according to specific test criterion.== Test scripts are executed on the [[SUT (system under test)]] manually or automatically. Finally, GUI oracles yield test verdicts by comparing effective results of test scripts with the expected ones.

This paper proposes to leverage [[UIDL (User Interface Description Language)]] dedicated to build
models of advanced GUIs, in order to drive the generation of test scenarios.
