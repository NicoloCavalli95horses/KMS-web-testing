## Definition

Similar to:  [[EFG (event flow graph)]], it describe the events net a GUI but it puts more focus on the sequences and the dependences.

First, the possible events are extracted from the GUI:

![[event_sequence_graph.png]]

Then, an event flow graph is create, abstracting away the interface details:

![[event_flow_graph 1.png]]

All the valid sequences are identifies:

![[event_sequences.png]]

The test sequences are logically inferred (since a test cannot start on e4, a step back is required)

Also called: GUI-based scenarios

### Applications

- automated testing
- creating app usage documentation

### Techniques

Event sequences can be generated by relying on:
- [[static analysis]]
- [[dynamic analysis]]
- [[symbolic execution]]
- [[concolic execution]]
- execution traces
- manually definitions made by programmers
- random chains of events without any knowledge of the app (e.g. Android UI Monkey)
