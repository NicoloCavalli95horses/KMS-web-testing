Consent confirmation (https://gdpr-info.eu/) before interviews
Sweden, Brasil: strong on empirical studies

Make sure the definition of the variable is clear before asking it to the participants of the study (e.g., what does it mean "computer"?)

Negation has cognitive effort

Framing the question impact the outcome in empirical research

### Types of validity

 - **construct validity**: measurement bias, wrong reference theory
 - **internal validity**:  mortality, instrumentation bias, learning bias
 - **conclusion validity**: lack of statistical significance, reliability of measurements, noise, randomness
 - **external validity**: being able to generalize effectively, sample quality, external variables not considered (e.g., tiredness)

### Causality and correlation

- spurious correlations may happen (https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)

## Triangulation

Use multiple methods/measurements to cross-validate the results

### Cargo cult

Do not repeat/do something without really understanding it, just because everyone does it. Cargo cult reduce credibility and trustworthiness


Negative results are not non-results

A good data presentation can be useful to find logical errors or bias
