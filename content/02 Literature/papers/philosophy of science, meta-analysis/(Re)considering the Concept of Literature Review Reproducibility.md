## Context

Literature reviews produce valuable insights by:
- describing a phenomenon (==narrative review==)
- understanding a phenomenon (==scoping review==)
- explaining a phenomenon (==realist review==)
- testing a theory (==meta-analysis==)

## Approach

Qualitative analysis of papers related to philosophy of science

## Results

Different concepts are crucial to understand if you want to build a good systematic literature review:
- **systematicity**: a disposition towards organized, methodical, and orderly inquiry that uses various methods and processes to search, screen, assess, analyze and interpret relevant information with a view to achieving a set of specific research goals
- **transparency**: the extend to which review process is made explicitly
- **reproducibility**: it has been defined as
	- the ability to ==re-perform the methods== of a research, but allowing different results
	- the ability to ==duplicate the results== of a research using the same methods or dataset
- **replicability**: a study is replicable if the results of a completely new and independent study that use different data and methods corroborate the results of the previous one

The element of a literature review that should be reproducible may vary from discipline to discipline

To solve the problem of having multiple definitions for reproducibility, the author propose to use **repeatability** to indicate the ability to ==re-perform the methods== of a research. This is especially important in the IT field
