## Definition

A fitness function is a ==function used in optimization problems to evaluate the *quality* or *fitness* of a candidate solution==.

It returns a **numerical value that represents how well a solution satisfies the criteria** of the specific objective.

**Why is it useful?**
- The fitness function guides the search or optimization process
- It determines which solutions are better and should be kept
- It allows learning or optimization algorithms (such as Hill Climbing,[[GA (genetic algorithm)]]) to iterate towards better solutions.

It is essential in contexts where we explore a very large solution space.
