## Definition

Usability testing is a [[black-box testing]] techniques of testing the functionality of a website, app, or product by ==observing real users as they attempt to complete tasks on it==. The users are usually observed by researchers working for a business during either an in-person or, more commonly, a remote usability testing session.

Questions related to usability testing:
- is the user interface tailored to the end user?
- are the output of the system meaningful and non-insulting?
- are the error diagnostics comprehensible to the end user?
- is the interface consistent?
- is the system easy to learn? (**learnability**)
- is easy to use the system after a period of non-use? (**memorability or user recall**)
- does the user like the interface?

With the usability test, the user experience - and the ability to complete tasks - is evaluated. 

**Who should perform the test**: 5 to 8 testers that are not familiar with the software should be enough

**Usability testing techniques**
- *thinking aloud*: the user speaks aloud his thoughts and observations while he is performing the assigned task
- *eye tracking*: the way the user read an interface using is eyes is recorded. This data may be associated with the thinking aloud process
- *usability questionnaire*:
