Very short paper (3 pages), unknown conference

## Context

A [[SW (Service Worker)]] is an essential component of a [[PWA (progressive web application)]] to enhance the users' browsing experience by using a cache, synchronizing in the background, and being executed in a different thread from the browser. 

The main goal of this paper is to introduce the existing studies on the PWA attacks, and discuss their implications for the new researchers who dive into this area.
