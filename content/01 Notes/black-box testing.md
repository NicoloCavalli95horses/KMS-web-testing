## Definition

A "black box" approach does not consider the internal structure, design, and product implementation. In other words, the tester does not know the internal functioning of the [[SUT (system under test)]]. The Black Box only evaluates the external behavior of the system. The inputs received by the system and the outputs or responses it produces are tested.

**Key features:**
- considers only external behavior
- carried out by testers (with an end-user perspective)
- no need to have knowledge on specific programming languages or implementation details
- it exposes ambiguities or inconsistencies in the requirements specifications
- used in system testing or [[acceptance testing]]
- less time consuming compared to [[white-box testing]]
- it focuses on the behavior of the system
- it is not suitable for algorithms testing

**Exhaustive input testing** (p.9): making use of every possible input condition as test case

Also known as: *data-driven testing, functional testing, closed-box testing, input-output-driven testing*
