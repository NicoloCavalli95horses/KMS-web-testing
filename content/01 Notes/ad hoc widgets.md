## Definition

*Ad hoc widgets*: non-standard widgets developed specifically for a [[GUI (graphical user interface)]]. Such widgets involve multi-event interactions (in opposition to mono-event interactions, e.g. multi-touch interactions for zooming, rotating), and/or [[multi-modal interactions]] that aim at being more adapted, natural to users.

A simple example of such widgets is the drawing area of graphical editors with which users interact using more complex interactions such as pencil-based or multi-touch interactions.

GUIs containing such widgets are called [[Post-WIMP]] GUIs
