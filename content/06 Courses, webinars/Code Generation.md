Combination of formal methods, AI and software engineering to produce quality code

Challenges:
- **Logic**: not all specification can be translated in pure logical terms
- **Examples**: explaining a concept through examples may not be enough to cover all the corner cases
- **Natural language**: too high level for certain problems

**Framework for code synthesis**
- DSL ([[domain]] specific languages)
- logic modulo theories
- logic programming (see [[prolog (programming language)]])
- functional programming
- code as text (LLM)
