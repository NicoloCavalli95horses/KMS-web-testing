## Definition

Mental models are described as internal models of the external world
- Their crucial feature is that ==they mimic the causal structure of some real world entity or process==
- Mental models simulate real-world processes under various conditions, which is the basis of the decision-making faculty.

Our models of the world get richer with experience, which enables more
true-to-life simulations, and therefore better decisions.

### How a mental model is built

- users develop a mental model as a result of interacting with the user interface
-  mental models are formed from observable experience linking causes and effects, and this leads to ==expectations and predictions of phenomena==
