Warp repairs from an intrusion by rolling back parts of the database to a version before the attack, and replaying subsequent legitimate actions. Warp allows administrators to retroactively patch security vulnerabilities---i.e., apply new security patches to past executions---to recover from intrusions without requiring the administrator to track down or even detect attacks. Warp's time-travel database allows fine-grained rollback of database rows, and enables repair to proceed concurrently with normal operation of a web application. Finally, Warp captures and replays user input at the level of a browser's DOM, to recover from attacks that involve a user's browser. For a web server running MediaWiki, Warp requires no application source code changes to recover from a range of common web application vulnerabilities with minimal user input at a cost of 24--27\% in throughput and 2--3.2 GB/day in storage.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Twenty-Third ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles}, pages = {101â€“114}, numpages = {14}, location = {Cascais, Portugal}, series = {SOSP '11} }
