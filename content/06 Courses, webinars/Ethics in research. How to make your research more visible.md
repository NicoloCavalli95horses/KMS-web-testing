https://osf.io/ platform to deposit preregistration of studies (protocols)
- in some cases (medicine) is required to have your protocol approved before publishing the research
- make it possible to receive feedback sooner

**Harking**: the bad practice of making hypothesis after results are known. This is scientific misconducts. The preregistration is supposed to prevent harking

**Nepotistic or predatory journals**: your friend or family are part of the journal's board, so the peer-review of the research is biased

**Where to register a study**
- Prospero for biology and health sciences
- Zenodo for every discipline. You can put here publication, dataset, and receive feedback from the community
- OSF for psychology, medicine and hard sciences
- PCR RR (peer-community review) can review the preprint deposited in the previous platforms. A positive feedback from PCR RR makes you more likely to be published in a high-ranked journal
