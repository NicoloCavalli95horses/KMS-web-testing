## Definition

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was created to provide a common visual modeling language, rich in both semantics and syntax, for the architecture, design, and implementation of complex software systems, both structurally and behaviorally. UML is also used in areas other than software development, such as process flow in manufacturing.

It is similar to blueprints used in other fields and consists of different types of diagrams. Overall, UML diagrams describe the boundaries, structure, and behavior of the system and the objects within it.

UML is not a programming language, but there are tools that can be used to generate code in various languages ​​using UML diagrams. UML has a direct relationship with object-oriented analysis and design.
