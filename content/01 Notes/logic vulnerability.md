## Definition

Logic vulnerabilities cause a program to operate incorrectly or exhibit unexpected behavior.

**Types**
- **data dependent**: a logic error in a computation
- **control-check dependent**: a logic error in a program control
- **control-flow dependent**: a sequence of event is expected by the application. If this sequence is tampered with, a logic vulnerability may occur [[(Ben Jaballah, Kheir, et al., 2016)]]
