## Definition

As a [[black-box testing]] technique, [[error]] guessing comes with experience and intuition. It consists of enumerate a list of possible errors or [[error]]-prone situations ==pulling from personal experience, or knowledge of the context==. Test cases are then derived from that list.
- test cases associated may be associated with assumptions that the programmer might have made when reading the specification
