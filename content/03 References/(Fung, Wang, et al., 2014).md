In real-world systems such as online banking transfer, traversing multiple pages with parameters contributed by both the user and server is a must, and hence the applications have to enforce workflow and parameter dependency controls across multiple requests. An application that applies insufficient server-side input validations is however vulnerable to parameter tampering attacks, which manipulate the exchanged parameters. Existing fuzzing-based scanning approaches however neglected these important controls, and this caused their fuzzing requests to be dropped before they can reach any vulnerable code. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identify the workflow and parameter dependent constraints, which are then maintained and leveraged for automatic detection of server acceptances during fuzzing. We realized the approach by building a generic blackbox parameter tampering scanner. It successfully uncovered a number of severe vulnerabilities, including one from the largest multi-national banking website, which other scanners miss.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 9th ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security}, pages = {341â€“352}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {in-context fuzzing, parameter dependency, parameter tampering, state-aware fuzzing}, location = {Kyoto, Japan}, series = {ASIA CCS '14} }
