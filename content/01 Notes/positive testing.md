## Definition

**Positive testing** means trying to lead the [[SUT (system under test)]] to the expected output or behavior. A desirable outcome is studied given a desirable input.

**Example**
The SUT should allow entering characters that are allowed in a login form. The desirable behavior, allowing regular characters, is put under test.

Opposed to [[negative testing]].
