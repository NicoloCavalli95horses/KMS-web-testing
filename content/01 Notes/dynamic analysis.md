## Main concepts


Dynamic program analysis is the act of ==analyzing software that involves executing a program== â€“ as opposed to [[static analysis]], which does not execute it. This method involves running a program on a suite of tests to observe its behaviour in real-time, that means its performance and the final output.

Dynamic analysis can focus on different aspects of the software, including but not limited to:
- behavior,
- test coverage,
- performance,
- security

## Examples of dynamic analysis tools

- **Valgrind**: a framework used to detect memory losses or error and profiling
- **JMeter**: a tool used to test performances in web application
## Advantages

- Runtime bug detection
- Performance analysis
- Output check
## Limits

- The analysis is strongly dependent on the tests, that are manually provided
- Bugs and issues are detected late and only in execution
