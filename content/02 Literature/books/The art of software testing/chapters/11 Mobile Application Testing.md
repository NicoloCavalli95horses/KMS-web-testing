The key to creating successful test plans for your mobile applications is
to understand the mobile computing environment

**Mobile environment test design considerations**
- **connectivity**: device provisioning, network speed, latency, availability in remote areas
- **diversity devices**: web browsers, multiple versions of runtime
- **device constraints**: limited memory or processor, small screen size
- **input devices**: touch screen, stylus, mouse, buttons, rollers
- **installation and maintenance**: patching, upgrading
- **usability**

Using emulators is great way to start, but ultimately you will need to test real devices on real carrier networks.
