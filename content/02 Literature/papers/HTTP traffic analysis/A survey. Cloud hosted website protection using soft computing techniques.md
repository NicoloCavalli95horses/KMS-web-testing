Unsystematic literature review about HTTP analysis for EDoS
## Context

Cloud Service Providers usually offers website owners different plans to host their website. Often, the resources offered are limited, or the owners are expected ==to pay as they consume==.
- in [[DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)]] or [[EDoS (Economical Denial of Sustainability)]] attacks, the resources may be wasted by malicious users (bot)
- it is therefore very important to distinguish between legitimate users and bots, to save computational resources

This paper proposes a summary of the most used techniques to analyze the HTTP traffic aiming at identifying bots.
