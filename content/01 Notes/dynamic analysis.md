## Definition

Dynamic program analysis is the act of ==analyzing software that involves executing a program== â€“ as opposed to [[static analysis]], which does not execute it. This method involves running a program on a suite of tests to observe its behavior in real-time, that means its performance and the final output.

Dynamic analysis can focus on different aspects of the software, including but not limited to:
- behavior
- test coverage
- performance
- security
 
### Approaches

- [[DFS (depth-first search)]]: technique used to explore components and transitions in a GUI. With DFS, each root path is explored deeply until a final state is found, then a second root path is explored, and so on, until the whole paths are mapped.
- **non-uniform distribution search**: only relevant parts of the application are executed/analyzed, based on priority or needs

### Advantages

- Runtime bug detection
- Performance analysis
- Input/output check (see [[dynamic invariants]])
- High precision and accuracy

### Tools

Tools that use dynamic analysis for vulnerability detection are given specific rules and inputs for the code to run with

- **Valgrind**: a framework used to detect memory losses or error and profiling
- **JMeter**: a tool used to test performances in web application
- [[Iroh.js]]: intercept and manipulate data during execution

### Limits

- The analysis is strongly dependent on the tests, that are manually provided (input dependency)
- Bugs and issues are detected late and only in execution
- Low code coverage
- Slow speed


Taint analysis techniques, which *track the propagation of the tainted vulnerable values,* can be applied either directly to the code lines ([[static taint analysis]]) or to the program during its execution ([[dynamic taint analysis]]). [[(Kluban, Mannan, et al., 2024)]]
