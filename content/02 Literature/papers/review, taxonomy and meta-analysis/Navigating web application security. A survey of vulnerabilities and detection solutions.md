## Context

General literature review about web application vulnerabilities

## Approach

Non-systematic literature survey

## Results

he Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to a 300% increase in cyberattacks targeting NATO countries, with a particular focus on critical infrastructure, utilities, public services, and the media and information space.

- [[SQLIA (SQL injection attack)]]
- code execution
- [[XSS (cross site scripting)]]
- [[CSFR (cross-site request forgery)]]
- file inclusion
- [[DoS (Denial of Service)]]
- misconfiguration
- broken access control ([[RBAC (role-based access control)]] issues)
- [[SSRF (server-side request forgery)]]
- bypass
- identification and authentication failures
- [[XXE (XML external entities)]]
- insecure design
- [[directory traversal]]
- software and data integrity failure
- cryptographic failures
- vulnerable and outdated components
- security logging and monitoring failures
