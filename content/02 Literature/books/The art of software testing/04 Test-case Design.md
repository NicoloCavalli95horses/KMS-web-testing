# Design and creation of test cases

Guaranteeing the absence of all errors, as well as designing all the possible tests, is impossible. Therefore, the question is: *what subset of all possible test cases has the highest probability of detecting the most errors?*

Most used techniques and methodologies in [[black-box testing]]:
- [[EPM (Equivalence Partitioning Method)]]
- [[boundary value analysis]]
- [[cause-effect graphing]]
- [[error guessing]]

While, in [[white-box testing]]:
- [[logic coverage testing]]

Using a combination of these techniques provides a solid and rigorous test of a program
