## Definition

Mental models are described as internal representation of the external world
- ==they mimic the causal structure of real world to guide the behavior==
- they at the basis of the decision-making faculty
- our models of the world get richer with experience, which enables more true-to-life simulations, and therefore better decisions
- more detailed mental models are not necessarily more useful, and the amount of accuracy needed to make good predictions depends on oneâ€™s goals
### How a mental model is built

- users develop a mental model as a result of interacting with the user interface
-  mental models are formed from observable experience linking causes and effects, and this leads to ==expectations and predictions of phenomena==
