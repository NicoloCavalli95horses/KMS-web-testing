## Definition

Mental models are described as internal models of the external world
- Their crucial feature is that ==they mimic the causal structure of some real world entity or process==

Mental models simulate real-world processes under various conditions, which is the basis of the decision-making faculty.

Our models of the world get richer with experience, which enables more
true-to-life simulations, and therefore better decisions.
