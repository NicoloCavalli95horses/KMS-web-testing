Nevertheless, the number of [[Web application attacks]] is constantly increasing. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is one of the more serious threats to web applications that gained a lot of attention lately. It allows an attacker to perform malicious authorized actions originating in the end-users browser, without his knowledge. This paper presents a client-side policy enforcement framework to transparently protect the end-user against CSRF. To do so, the framework monitors all outgoing web requests within the browser and enforces a configurable cross-[[domain]] policy. The default policy is carefully selected to transparently operate in a web 2.0 context. In addition, the paper also proposes an optional server-side policy to improve the accuracy of the client-side policy enforcement. A prototype is implemented as a [[Firefox extension]], and is thoroughly evaluated in a web 2.0 context.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the First ACM Workshop on Secure Execution of Untrusted Code}, pages = {3â€“10}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {cross-site request forgery, run-time policy enforcement, [[Web application security]]}, location = {Chicago, Illinois, USA}, series = {SecuCode '09} }
