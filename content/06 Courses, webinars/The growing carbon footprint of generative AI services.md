abstract: "Over the last two decades, we have acknowledged the rise of AI algorithms starting from recommendation systems to speech and face recognition to the recent explosion of generative AI services for question answering, text writing as well as image and music generation. In parallel, most of Humanity has realized the magnitude of the environmental catastrophe it has caused, with climate change and five other of the nine planetary boundaries that are transgressed. These transgressions have led Humanity in the Anthropocene, i.e. out of the safe operating space, where we clearly see the effects of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.\r\rAI services are part of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) that contribute to the exceedance of these boundaries. In particular, the ICT sector was responsible of 2-4% of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2020. Since then, the GHG emissions (or carbon footprint) of the ICT sector has increased significantly with key datacenter operators such as Google and Microsoft reporting that the fast growth of the AI processing capacity has prevented them from reaching their climate targets. Indeed, their GHG emissions increase despite their investment in renewable electricity purchase. Therefore, voices across the world advocate for a responsible use of AI services for a few reasons including environmental ones.\r\rIn this talk, we will analyze the global warming contribution of the ICT sector and the impact that AI service emergence have on them. We will see why efficiency improvement is not enough to reach net-zero climate targets for the ICT sector, which calls for complementing it with a sufficiency mindset and alternative business models."

The ICT sector impacts the global greenhouse gas emission for 3%

We need to consider the life cycle of electronic products, from raw material extraction to end of life (waste). Currently, it is not possible to recycle completely an electronic product

Trend for ICT giants: +27% increase of semiconductor foundries from 2020 to 2023

Amazon does not report electricity consumption. Microsoft, and Google are at least transparent and share their data

Obviously, the demand of data centers is expected to grow in the next years

Other environmental impacts apart from Co2:
- change in biosphere integrity
- stratospheric ozone depletion
- increase in atmospheric aerosol loading
- ocean acidification
- modification of bio-geo-chemical flows
- freshwater change
- land system change (physical centers deployed somewhere impact the environment)
- climate change
- introduction of novel entities (chemical, PFAS, etc)
- change in biodiversity and ecosystem integrity

This processes are mostly interdependent, especially on climate change and biosphere integrity

Social dangers of Generative AI

AI can be used to optimize flight paths to reduce Co2 emission, and Google Maps use AI to optimize the recommended path to reduce usage of gas:
- 10:1 ratio between what you may save and what it is needed to run this LLM
- this kind of examples are used to promote a narrative that AI in intrinsically good

Digital / ICT are at the same time ==part of the problem and part of the solution==

Is remote working good for the environment?
- a study from Orange confirmed the hypothesis
- studies are possible only at the micro scale, local level, on a per service basis
- be careful to generalizations

**Koomey's laws:** the number of computations per kWh of electrical energy is doubling every 1.2-2.5 years

Training algorithms optimization to reduce environmental impact

**Rebound effect**: reduction in expected gains from new technologies that increase the efficiency of resource use, because of behavioral or other systemic responses. These responses diminish the beneficial effects of the new technology or other measures taken

**Low-hanging fruits theory**: do first what is easy, and later what costs effort
- we have already achieved the "easy improvements" regarding energy consumption solutions

Depending on the model uses, a ==100-word email generated by AI may consumes half a liter of water==
