## Main concepts

Dual booting is a computer configuration that allows you to ==install and use two different operating systems on the same device==, choosing which one to boot each time you turn on your computer.
- For example, you might have both Windows and Linux installed on your PC, and when you start up your computer, it will ask you which operating system you want to use.

## How does it work?

When you install two operating systems in dual boot, your computer's hard drive is divided into multiple partitions. Each operating system is installed on a separate partition. When you start your computer, a program called a [[bootloader]] (such as GRUB for Linux) handles the process of choosing which operating system to boot.

## Advantages of dual booting

**Maximum compatibility**
It allows you to use both operating systems with direct access to your computer's hardware, resulting in the best possible performance.

**Versatility**
You can take advantage of the strengths of both operating systems. For example, you might use Windows for gaming or specialized software and Linux for development or other tasks.

**Independence**
The two operating systems work completely separately, so if one of them has problems, the other remains usable.

## Disadvantages of dual boot

**Disk space management**
Requires partitioning the hard drive, which can complicate managing the available space.

**Risk of conflicts**
Although they are separate, some operations (such as changing partitions or updating the bootloader) can create problems if not managed correctly.

**Boot time**
Every time you turn on your computer, you have to choose which operating system to boot, which can slow down direct access to your tasks.

## Concrete example

Let's say you are a graphic designer who uses Windows-specific software such as Adobe Photoshop, but you are also a developer who prefers to program in a Linux environment. With a dual boot configuration, you can install Windows and Linux on the same computer. When you need to work on your graphic projects, choose to boot Windows. When you need to program, choose to boot Linux.

In short, dual boot is a solution that allows you to have the best of two (or more) operating systems on a single device, using the one that best suits your needs.
