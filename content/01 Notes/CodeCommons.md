CodeCommons is an ambitious project to create the worldâ€™s most comprehensive digital commons for code.

Building on the existing foundation of [[SH (Software Heritage)]], the largest publicly available source code archive, CodeCommons aims to bring into one place ==all the critical and qualified information needed to create smaller, better datasets for the next generation of AI tools==.
