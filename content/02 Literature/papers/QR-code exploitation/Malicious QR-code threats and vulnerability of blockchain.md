## Context

This paper discusses the security of using the symbiosis of [[blockchain]] and [[QR-code]] technologies, and the vulnerabilities that arise in this case. The following vulnerabilities were considered:
- fake QR generators,
- stickers for cryptomats,
- [[phishing]] using QR-codes,
- create Malicious QR-codes for Hack Phones

The possibility of creating the following malicious QR codes while using the QRGen tool was considered: 
- [[SQLIA (SQL injection attack)]],
- [[XSS (cross site scripting)]],
- Command Injection,
- Format String,
- [[XXE (XML external entities)]],
- String Fuzzing,
- SSI (Server-Side Includes) Injection,
- LFI (Local File Inclusion)
- [[directory traversal (path traversal)]]
## Approach

Describe the paper approach in simple term.
