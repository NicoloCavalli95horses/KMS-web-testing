Unsystematic literature review on [[clickjacking]]
## Context

[[clickjacking]] is the hijacking of user clicks to initiate unintended actions

Initially, these attacks were limited to online social networks (*likejacking*). Now, advanced techniques such as:
- content extraction,
- text field injection,
- forced drag-and-drop,
- HTML source extraction

are used to a large extent to trick and fool internet users
