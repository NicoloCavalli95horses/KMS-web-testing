## Definition

Phishing refers to the practice of ==manipulating the user with the goal of stealing confidential information== (login credentials, payment card details, etc). This is usually done:
- by creating fake web pages or emails that mimic legitimate resources

**Why people still fall for phishing?**
The average user is unable to distinguish malicious web pages from legitimate ones and does not have enough technical information about URLs. Therefore:
- does not know which URL to trust (for example: embedded in e-mail text, in a displayed tooltip, in the status bar)
- does not see the whole URL of a web page, due to tiny URL services
- clicks on links without checking, for an habituation effect
