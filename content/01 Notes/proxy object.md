## Definition

A proxy object is a programming construct that provides a meta-programming API to developers by intercepting accesses to a given target object, and allowing the programmer to define handler functions (called *traps*) that are executed each time a specific operation is performed on the object
- This is frequently used to provide features such as security, debugging, profiling, and logging
