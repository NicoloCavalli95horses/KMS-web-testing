## Definition

In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.

In general, a brute force attack involves guessing sensitive information by trying all possible combinations of values.
- Of course, this is only feasible if the total amount of combinations is reasonable and will not take the computer years to process.
