Neither authentication nor session management was considered when the HTTP protocol was invented, because it is a stateless protocol. So, managing these feature over the web can be challenging.

Attacking how a cookie is generated is very difficult to guess, even when a hacker has tons of processing power. A much more applicable attack is to ==investigate how the application uses the cookie.==
- This type of attack doesnâ€™t require understanding how a cookie was generated, but instead focuses on ==accessing and using the cookie== in unpredictable ways

**One failure is enough**
Authentication actually takes place in many other parts of the web application other than the main login page. It is also present when you *change your password*, *update your account information*, use the *password recovery functionality*, *answering secret questions*, and when you *use the remember me option.*
- ==If any of these authentication processes is flawed, the security of all the other authentication mechanisms may be compromised==
