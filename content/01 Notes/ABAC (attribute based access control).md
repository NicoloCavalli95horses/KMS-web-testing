## Definition

Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) will grant or deny user access ==based on arbitrary attributes of the user and arbitrary attributes of the object==, and environment conditions that may be globally recognized, and more relevant to the policies at hand.

Access Control design may start simple but can often become complex and feature-heavy security control.

When evaluating the access control capability of software frameworks, ensure that your access control functionality will allow for customization for your specific access control feature need.
