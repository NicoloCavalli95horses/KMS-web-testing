## Definition

A driver in software provides a programming interface to control and manage specific lower-level interfaces that are often linked to a specific type of hardware, or other low-level service.

In general, a driver is a software abstraction that makes it possible to work with another piece of software. 

> [!NOTE]
> In the context of testing, a driver may, for example, generate the inputs required by the function under test, execute the function under test and return the results.
