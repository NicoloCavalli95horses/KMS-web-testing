## Definition

A honeypot in cybersecurity is a decoy security mechanism designed to attract cyber attackers so that security researchers can observe how they operate and what they might be looking for. The honeypot, typically isolated from the organization’s main production environment, serves as a decoy to lure cybercriminals into contact with the system without endangering the organization’s data.
