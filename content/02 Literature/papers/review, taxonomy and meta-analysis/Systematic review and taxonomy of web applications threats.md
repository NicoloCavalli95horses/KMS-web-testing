## Context

The open nature of web applications and their wide usage in delivering critical services made them a ==prime target of cyber-attacks==
 - the ==rapid evolution and advance in web technologies== have made the structure and interaction between the web client-side and server-side components of modern web apps ==more and more complexes, rising new challenges==

==Web apps security has become increasingly challenging==

Web security issues: targets user's browser or the web app hosting server
## Approach

The paper :
- ==defines== various requirements of a good ==taxonomy==
- analyzes the pros and cons of previous web security threats taxonomies
- proposes a new taxonomy that provides the ten requirements of a good taxonomy
- the proposed taxonomy integrates both client-side web threats, and server-side web threats

**Methods**
- [[SLR (systematic literature review)]]


> [!warning] Different taxonomies
> Different taxonomies can be constructed depending on the criteria according to which a phenomenon is included or excluded from a category. Vulnerabilities may be classified according to:
> - prevalence
> - severity (risks)
> - similar context 

A good taxonomy is based on approved content (peer-reviewed papers), is understandable, exhaustive, deterministic, mutually exclusive, reproducible, conforms to standards, has well-defined terms, unambiguous, useful
