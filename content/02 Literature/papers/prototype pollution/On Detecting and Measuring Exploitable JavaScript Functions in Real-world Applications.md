Massive paper with relevant insights about JS vulnerabilities, with a focus on [[prototype pollution]] and [[ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)]]
## Context

In this article, we develop
- a vulnerability detection framework that uses vulnerable pattern recognition and textual similarity methods to detect vulnerable functions in real-world JavaScript projects
- a static multi-file [[static taint analysis]] mechanism to further assess the impact of the vulnerabilities on the whole project
- a comprehensive dataset of 1.360 verified vulnerable JavaScript functions using the Snyk vulnerability database and the VulnCode-DB project

## Introduction

The study of vulnerabilities in JS dependencies has led to the flagging a number of projects as vulnerable, due to the presence of vulnerable dependencies. In reality, many such projects (73%) are not really vulnerable, as they do not actually use the vulnerable functions. 

There are insufficient datasets of vulnerable code and therefore it is complicated to train models or to test other mitigation solution properly.

The objective of our study is to assess active JavaScript projects in the real world to find vulnerable functions in their source code. We gather JS from 3 sources
- NPM packages
- Chrome web extensions
- top popular websites

We develop a vulnerability detection framework based on the following approaches
1. vulnerable pattern recognition, which uses our manually developed patterns to perform a semantics-based search in code. This was done with a [[static analysis]] tool (Semgrep)
2. search based on textual similarity, which uses content-sensitive and cryptographic hash comparison. We tokenize each function from vulnerable and real-world datasets and generate a content-sensitive hash value using the SimHash algorithm along with a SHA-1 cryptographic hash value. For each hash value from the real-world dataset, we then search for matches in the vulnerable function dataset
3. static taint analysis to verify the exploitability of the vulnerability (that is, if the vulnerable function is actually reachable by an attacker). [[AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)]] representation were used with a File Dependency Graph (FDG), which enables multi-file taint-tracking
