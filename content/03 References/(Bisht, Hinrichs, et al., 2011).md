Malicious users who circumvent the client can capitalize on the missing server validation. In this paper, we describe WAPTEC, a tool that is designed to automatically identify parameter tampering vulnerabilities and generate exploits by construction to demonstrate those vulnerabilities. WAPTEC involves a new approach to whitebox analysis of the server's code. We tested WAPTEC on six open source applications and found previously unknown vulnerabilities in every single one of them.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security}, pages = {575â€“586}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {constraint solving, exploit construction, parameter tampering, program analysis}, location = {Chicago, Illinois, USA}, series = {CCS '11} }
