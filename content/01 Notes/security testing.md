## Definition

Security testing is a process intended to detect flaws in the security mechanisms of an information system, to protect data and maintain functionality as intended.
- Passing the security testing process is not an indication that no flaws exist or that the system adequately satisfies the security requirements.

Typical security requirements may include specific elements of ==confidentiality, integrity, authentication, availability, authorization and non-repudiation==.

Actual security requirements tested depend on the security requirements implemented by the system.
