## Context

To this day, PHP is the server-side language that drives over 75% of the websites. Automated security testing tools promise to facilitate the discovery of vulnerabilities. One such approach is [[fuzzling]] testing, in which a fuzzer generates seemingly random inputs fed to the target application to trigger unintended behavior, potentially leading to vulnerabilities

**Contributions**
- A novel crawler-free approach to seeding the fuzzer with endpoints, allowing more fine-grained control over the fuzzing scope
- A novel [[instrumentation]] approach without modifications to the fuzzed applicationâ€™s source code or related components (i.e., databases), capable of intercepting PHP exceptions or errors, and bypassing authentication and authorization functionality to collect more code coverage
- A novel vulnerability detection approach to discover web vulnerability, supporting parallel fuzzing out-of-the-box, making it suitable for large-scale fuzzing testing
