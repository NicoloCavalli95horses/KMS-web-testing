## Definition

A **testbed** is a platform for ==conducting rigorous, transparent, and replicable testing of scientific theories, computing tools, and new technologies.==

The term is used across many disciplines to describe **experimental research** and **new product development platforms** and environments. A testbed is mostly used for:
- hands-on prototype development in manufacturing industries (such as automobiles, aircraft engines or systems)
- intellectual property refinement in such fields as computer software development

In software development, testbedding is a method of testing a particular module (function, class, or library) in an isolated fashion.
It may be used as a **proof of concept** or when a new module is tested apart from the program or system it will later be added to. 
- A skeleton framework is implemented around the module so that the module behaves as if already part of the larger program.
