This paper examines the [[DOM clobbering]] vulnerability, providing a systematic evaluation of the attack surface, a measurement of affected and vulnerable websites and a review and evaluation of defenses.

A tool (TheThing) is proposed to automatically detect DOM clobbering.

> [!summary]
> The authors' findings show that the attack surface of DOM clobbering is large, with ==31.432 possible attacks== (only 481 of which are commonly known), and that the prevalence of the vulnerability affects ==9.8% of the 5,000 most visited websites on the Internet, including GitHub, Fandom, Trello, Vimeo, TripAdvisor, WikiBooks.==
