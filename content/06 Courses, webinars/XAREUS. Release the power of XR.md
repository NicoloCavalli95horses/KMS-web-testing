abstract: Xareus is a suite of tools integrated into the Unity3D game engine, designed to accelerate the development of interactive applications, reduce the need for coding and enable domain experts to customise their projects more effectively. At its core lies the scenario engine, a powerful and extensible framework that supports contextual execution and parallelism, enabling for more flexible and efficient applications.

XAREUS: mixed reality, augmented reality, HCI
- is a set of tool integrated into Unity3D
- speed up the development process
- minimize the need for custom code

Is a **scenario engine**
- all apps embeds scenarios in a way of another
- visual formalism can speed up development, allow domain experts to modify scenario without coding skills
- make reading, writing, annotating and debugging easier

State-machine are used to describe a state of an object

Binary trees are used to support decisions in updating scenarios

Safe petri net: more advanced state-machine that allows parallelism (you can update different subtree at the same time)
- they are more expressive than binary trees
- multiple places (states) can be activated at the same time

Q: is learning transferable to real world? (es. welding)
