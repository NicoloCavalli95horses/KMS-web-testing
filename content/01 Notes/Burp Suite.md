## Definition

Burp Suite is a proprietary software tool for security assessment and penetration testing of web applications.

It was initially developed in 2003-2006 by Dafydd Stuttard to automate his own security testing needs, after realizing the capabilities of automatable web tools like Selenium. Stuttard created the company PortSwigger to flagship Burp Suite's development. A community, professional, and enterprise version of this product are available.
