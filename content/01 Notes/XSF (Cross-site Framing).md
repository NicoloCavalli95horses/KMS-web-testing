> [!NOTE] XSF attacks
> XSF (Cross-site framing) attacks do not require physical access or control over the computer by malware or otherwise and are launched online

In many countries, computer records are often used in criminal investigations and admitted as legal evidence. Digital, computer, and network forensics, the science of collecting forensic evidence related to the use of computers and networks and to crimes involving them, is an important and well-established discipline.
- usually, computer records reflect the action of the user, even when these actions  are illegal or violate social, business, or ethical codes
- however, it is indeed possible to manipulate computer records to cause a false impression of wrongdoing (to frame a user)
- Michael Fiola, 2007, was charged with possession of child pornography and spent 5 years in prison. He was innocent, his laptop had a malware that downloaded this material

**Intentional framing**: a victim is chosen by the attacker and his browser's history, or his file system is filled up with illegal material
- this can have legal consequences, as the Micheal Fiola case
- or private-personal consequences, such as discredit a victim in the social, workplace, business or political context, by polluting user personalization algorithms in social media

**Unintentional framing**: the attacker choses a random victim just to hide his own traces

Cross-site framing can go undetected by forensic investigation procedure (until 2015)

**Framing without a malware** [[(Gelernter, Grinstein, et al., 2015)]]:
- the victim is tricked into visit a malicious website
