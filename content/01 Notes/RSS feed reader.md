## Definition

An RSS feed reader is a software or service that allows you to aggregate content from multiple websites into one place. Essentially, instead of visiting dozens of sites to read news or updates, an ==RSS reader automatically collects articles published by the sites you subscribe to, via their RSS (or Atom, a similar format) feeds.==

### How it works

- A website publishes an RSS feed, which is an XML file containing headlines, links, summaries, and sometimes full content
- The RSS reader periodically downloads this feed
- The user sees all updates in a single interface, without having to visit individual sites.

### Examples of RSS readers

- Feedly
- Inoreader
- Thunderbird
- mobile apps like Reeder
