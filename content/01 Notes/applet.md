## Definition

An applet is any small application that performs one specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated widget engine or a larger program, often as a plug-in.

The term is frequently used to refer to a **Java applet**, a program written in the Java programming language that is designed to be placed on a web page.
- Applets are typical examples of transient and auxiliary applications that do not monopolize the user's attention
- Applets are not full-featured application programs, and are intended to be easily accessible.
