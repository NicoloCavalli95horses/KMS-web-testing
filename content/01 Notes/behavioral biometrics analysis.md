## Definition

Behavioral biometrics analysis is a passive monitoring of user characteristics and it is a relatively new research direction.

Biometrics-based user recognition methods can be ==combined with traditional methods== to enhance the recognition of a user, or of categories of users, on the web:
- input devices such as keyboard, computer mouse or touch screen provide data with hidden biometric characteristics
- keystroke dynamics have been studied taking into account keys presses latencies
- mouse patterns have been studied taking into account mouse strokes, clicks, movement velocity, time spent interacting with widgets, ...
- this field of research is linked to [[browser fingerprinting]]
