abstract: "\rThe relationship between scientific research and mainstream media significantly influences the public understanding of science. Yet we observe fundamental tensions between journalistic imperatives and scientific methodology. News coverage doesn't follow the same patterns as academic communication norms. As they become news stories, peer-reviewed publications undergo systematic transformation: selection, simplification, and narrative construction. This process often favors attention-grabbing discoveries and over simplification over methodological nuance.\r\rThe digital era has introduced new challenges to this relationship. We're seeing more \"clickbait,\" exaggerated claims, and lower-quality reporting as media companies compete for attention. The rarefaction of specialized science journalists has given the responsibility to generalist reporters to cover complex scientific topics, while news outlets push for quick stories that will engage the audience, which often clashes with the inherent complexity of scientific research.\r\rThis presentation examines how mainstream media processes scientific information and explores how the constraints of journalism affect the science news we consume."

Time constraints in publishing content. Tendency to cut the complexity of scientific posts
- selection: of the most interesting/impacting content
- simplification
- narrative construction: need to catch the attention of the reader

Fields that are more covered in mainstream media (in order):
- health and medicine
- environmental and climate
- space and astronomy
- technology and digital
- archaeology and paleontology

Even science journalists do not have necessarily a scientific background

News need controversial and fuzzy material more than it needs right and correct content

Scientific topics are rarely covered solely to share new scientific information. Often, they are framed through political, economical, cultural perspectives to attract readers

Using of
- clickbait title
- oversimplification
- sensationalisms
- editorial constraints

Problematic trends in science coverage:
- science as a (forced) debate
- false equivalence (comparing the opinion of a professor to fringe voices)
- lack of corrections: news outlets rarely update or correct inaccurate scientific reporting

The future:
- declining resources: fewer specialized science journalists
- lower standard
- AI creating content
- anti-science trends

Q.
- Does having low quality scientific news/fake news damage the news brand?
- Can misreporting scientific discovery damage the credibility of the scientists involved in the discovery?
- What about scientific references?
