## Definition

- A fine-tuned access control strategy ensuring that users ==only get the specific permissions they need for a given task==
- Often implemented alongside [[RBAC (role-based access control)]] or [[ABAC (attribute based access control)]]

### Example

A database administrator can run queries but cannot modify security settings or access customer PII unless explicitly needed
