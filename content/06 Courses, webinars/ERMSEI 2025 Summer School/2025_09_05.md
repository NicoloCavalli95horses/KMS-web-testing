Convince people to complete your survey
- take advantage of social event
- find actual spot where relevant people may gather
- offer a coffee, the, etc
- solve a problem for them before asking the favor to complete your survey

**Theories**
A priori expectations about your results. It is not possible to be completely theory-free
- a theory is a complex hypothesis

Try to balance qualitative and quantitative research. Ideally, where different studies point to the same results, that's where the truth is
