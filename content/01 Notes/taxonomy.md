A good taxonomy is useful to:
- help educate software developers or students to better and faster understand the context
- have a backbone on which to base further studies

> [!warning] Different taxonomies
> Different taxonomies can be constructed depending on the criteria according to which a phenomenon is included or excluded from a category. Vulnerabilities may be classified according to:
> - prevalence
> - severity (risks)
> - similar context 

A good taxonomy is based on approved content (peer-reviewed papers), is understandable, exhaustive, deterministic, mutually exclusive, reproducible, conforms to standards, has well-defined terms, unambiguous, useful
