## Definition

Several definition of privacy have been proposed over time, since the problem has deep philosophical implications:
- the right to be let alone
- the right to be protected from unsolicited distribution of personal information
- privacy as a situation in which *a plurality of different things do not share one element in common*
- an individual’s right to self-determination over their body

> [!warning] A contextual problem
> How privacy is constructed can vary between places, cultures or over time

**Data is money**
Personal information is the new oil. Rapid innovation of data collection and measurement technologies are redefining the nature and scope of personal information that can be recorded and monetized by governments and businesses

### Types of privacy

- **Physio-spatial**: the privacy of one’s home, one’s location in the real world.
- **Relational**: being able to maintain relationships privately; protection of family life
- **Decisional**: an individual’s right to self-determination, to decide in personal matters over the body, thoughts, actions and consumption without interference
- **Informational**: the digitization of information and an individual’s ability to access or control it.
